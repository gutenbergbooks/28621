<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From bodies various form'd, mutative shapes<br />
My Muse would sing:&mdash;Celestial powers give aid!<br />
From you those changes sprung,&mdash;inspire my pen;<br />
Connect each period of my venturous song<br />
Unsever'd, from old Chaös' rude misrule,<br />
Till now the world beneath Augustus smiles.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet nor earth nor sea their place possest,<br />
Nor that cerulean canopy which hangs<br />
O'ershadowing all, each undistinguish'd lay,<br />
And one dead form all Nature's features bore;<br />
Unshapely, rude, and Chaos justly nam'd.<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
Together struggling laid, each element<br />
Confusion strange begat:&mdash;Sol had not yet<br />
Whirl'd through the blue expanse his burning car:<br />
Nor Luna yet had lighted forth her lamp,<br />
Nor fed her waning light with borrowed rays.<br />
No globous earth pois'd inly by its weight,<br />
Hung pendent in the circumambient sky:<br />
The sky was not:&mdash;Nor Amphitrité had<br />
Clasp'd round the land her wide-encircling arms.<br />
Unfirm the earth, with water mix'd and air;<br />
Opaque the air; unfluid were the waves.<br />
Together clash'd the elements confus'd:<br />
Cold strove with heat, and moisture drought oppos'd;<br />
Light, heavy, hard, and soft, in combat join'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprose the world's great Lord,&mdash;the strife dissolv'd,<br />
The firm earth from the blue sky plac'd apart;<br />
Roll'd back the waves from off the land, and fixt<br />
Where pure ethereal joins with foggy air.<br />
Defin'd each element, and from the mass<br />
Chaötic, rang'd select, in concord firm<br />
He bound, and all agreed.  On high upsprung<br />
The fiery ether to the utmost heaven:<br />
The atmospheric air, in lightness next,<br />
Upfloated:&mdash;dense the solid earth dragg'd down<br />
The heavier mass; and girt on every side<br />
By waves circumfluent, seiz'd her place below.<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This done, the mass this deity unknown<br />
Divides;&mdash;each part dispos'd in order lays:<br />
First earth he rounds, in form a sphere immense,<br />
Equal on every side: then bids the seas,<br />
Pent in by banks, spread their rude waves abroad,<br />
By strong winds vext; and clasp within their arms<br />
The tortuous shores: and marshes wide he adds,<br />
Pure springs and lakes:&mdash;he bounds with shelving banks<br />
The streams smooth gliding;&mdash;slowly creeping, some<br />
The arid earth absorbs; furious some rush,<br />
And in the watery plain their waves disgorge;<br />
Their narrow bounds escap'd, to billows rise,<br />
And lash the sandy shores. He bade the plains<br />
Extend;&mdash;the vallies sink;&mdash;the groves to bloom;&mdash;<br />
And rocky hills to lift their heads aloft.<br />
And as two zones the northern heaven restrain,<br />
The southern two, and one the hotter midst,<br />
With five the Godhead girt th' inclosed earth,<br />
And climates five upon its face imprest.<br />
The midst from heat inhabitable: snows<br />
Eternal cover two: 'twixt these extremes<br />
Two temperate regions lie, where heat and cold<br />
Meet in due mixture; 'bove the whole light air<br />
Was hung:&mdash;as water floats above the land,<br />
So fire 'bove air ascends. Here he bade lodge,<br />
Thick clouds and vapors; thunders bellowing loud<br />
Terrific to mankind, and winds; which mixt<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
Sharp cold beget. But these to range at large<br />
The air throughout, his care forbade. E'en now<br />
Their force is scarce withstood; but oft they threat<br />
Wild ruin to the universe, though each<br />
In separate regions rules his potent blasts.<br />
Such is fraternal strife! Far to the east<br />
Where Persian mountains greet the rising sun<br />
Eurus withdrew. Where sinking Ph&oelig;bus' rays<br />
Glow on the western shores mild Zephyr fled.<br />
Terrific Boreas frozen Scythia seiz'd,<br />
Beneath the icy bear. On southern climes<br />
From constant clouds the showery Auster rains.<br />
The liquid ether high above he spread,<br />
Light, calm, and undefil'd by dregs terrene.<br />
Scarce were those bounds immutable arrang'd,<br />
When upward sprung the stars so long press'd down<br />
Beneath the heap chaötic, and along<br />
The path of heaven their blazing courses ran.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next that each separate element might hold<br />
Appropriate habitants,&mdash;the vault of heaven,<br />
Bright constellations and the gods receiv'd.<br />
To glittering fish allotted were the waves:<br />
To earth fierce brutes:&mdash;to agitated air,<br />
Light-plumag'd birds. A being more divine,<br />
Of soul exalted more, and form'd to rule<br />
The rest was wanting. Then he finish'd <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>!<br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
Or by the world's creator, power supreme,<br />
Form'd from an heavenly seed; or new-shap'd earth<br />
Late from celestial ether torn, and still<br />
Congenial warmth retaining, moisten'd felt,<br />
Prometheus' fire, and moulded took the form<br />
Of him all-potent. Others earth behold<br />
Pronely;&mdash;to man a face erect was given.<br />
The heavens he bade him view, and raise his eyes<br />
High to the stars. Thus earth of late so rude,<br />
So shapeless, man, till now unknown, became.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First sprung the age of gold. Unforc'd by laws<br />
Strict rectitude and faith, spontaneous then<br />
Mankind inspir'd. No judge vindictive frown'd;<br />
Unknown alike were punishment and fear:<br />
No strict decrees on brazen plates were seen;<br />
Nor suppliant crowd, with trembling limbs low bent,<br />
Before their judges bow'd. Unknown was law,<br />
Yet safe were all. Unhewn from native hills,<br />
The pine-tree knew the seas not, nor had view'd<br />
Regions unknown, for man not yet had search'd<br />
Shores distant from his own. The towns ungirt<br />
By trenches deep, laid open to the plain;<br />
Nor brazen trump, nor bended horn were seen,<br />
Helmet, nor sword; but conscious and secure,<br />
Unaw'd by arms the nations tranquil slept.<br />
The teeming earth by barrows yet unras'd,<br />
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
By ploughs unwounded, plenteous pour'd her stores.<br />
Content with food unforc'd, man pluck'd with ease<br />
Young strawberries from the mountains; cornels red;<br />
The thorny bramble's fruit; and acorns shook<br />
From Jove's wide-spreading tree. Spring ever smil'd;<br />
And placid Zephyr foster'd with his breeze<br />
The flowers unsown, which everlasting bloom'd.<br />
Untill'd the land its welcome produce gave,<br />
And unmanur'd its hoary crop renew'd.<br />
Here streams of milk, there streams of nectar flow'd;<br />
And from the ilex, drop by drop distill'd,<br />
The yellow honey fell. But, Saturn down<br />
To dusky Tartarus banish'd, all the world<br />
By Jove was govern'd. Then a silver age<br />
Succeeded; by the golden far excell'd;&mdash;<br />
Itself surpassing far the age of brass.<br />
The ancient durance of perpetual spring<br />
He shorten'd, and in seasons four the year<br />
Divided:&mdash;Winter, summer, lessen'd spring,<br />
And various temper'd autumn first were known.<br />
Then first the air with parching fervor dry,<br />
Glow'd hot;&mdash;then ice congeal'd by piercing winds<br />
Hung pendent;&mdash;houses then first shelter'd man;<br />
Houses by caverns form'd, with thick shrubs fenc'd,<br />
And boughs entwin'd with osiers. Then the grain<br />
Of Ceres first in lengthen'd furrows lay;<br />
And oxen groan'd beneath the weighty yoke.<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
Third after these a brazen race succeeds,<br />
More stern in soul, and more in furious war<br />
Delighting;&mdash;still to wicked deeds averse.<br />
The last from stubborn iron took its name;&mdash;<br />
And now rush'd in upon the wretched race<br />
All impious villainies: Truth, faith, and shame,<br />
Fled far; while enter'd fraud, and force, and craft,<br />
And plotting, with detested avarice.<br />
To winds scarce known the seaman boldly loos'd<br />
His sails, and ships which long on lofty hills<br />
Had rested, bounded o'er the unsearch'd waves.<br />
The cautious measurer now with spacious line<br />
Mark'd out the land, in common once to all;<br />
Free as the sun-beams, or the lucid air.<br />
Nor would the fruits and aliments suffice,<br />
The rich earth from her surface threw, but deep<br />
Within her womb they digg'd, and thence display'd,<br />
Riches, of crimes the prompter, hid far deep<br />
Close by the Stygian shades. Now murderous steel,<br />
And gold more murderous enter'd into day:<br />
Weapon'd with each, war sallied forth and shook<br />
With bloody grasp his loud-resounding arms.<br />
Now man by rapine lives;&mdash;friend fears his host;<br />
And sire-in-law his son;&mdash;e'en brethren's love<br />
Is rarely seen: wives plot their husbands' death;<br />
And husbands theirs design: step-mothers fierce<br />
The lurid poisons mix: th' impatient son<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
Enquires the limits of his father's years:&mdash;<br />
Piety lies neglected; and Astræa,<br />
Last of celestial deities on earth,<br />
Ascends, and leaves the sanguine-moisten'd land.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor high-rais'd heaven was more than earth secure.<br />
Giants, 'tis said, with mad ambition strove<br />
To seize the heavenly throne, and mountains pile<br />
On mountains till the loftiest stars they touch'd.<br />
But with his darted bolt all-powerful Jove,<br />
Olympus shatter'd, and from Pelion's top<br />
Dash'd Ossa. There with huge unwieldy bulk<br />
Oppress'd, their dreadful corses lay, and soak'd<br />
Their parent earth with blood; their parent earth<br />
The warm blood vivify'd, and caus'd assume<br />
An human form,&mdash;a monumental type<br />
Of fierce progenitors. Heaven they despise,<br />
Violent, of slaughter greedy; and their race<br />

This from his lofty seat beheld, and sigh'd;<br />
The recent bloody fact revolving deep,<br />
The Lycaönian feast, to few yet known.<br />
Incens'd with mighty rage, rage worthy Jove,<br />
He calls the council;&mdash;none who hear delay.<br />
A path sublime, in cloudless skies fair seen,<br />
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
They tread when tow'rd the mighty thunderer's dome,<br />
His regal court, th' immortals bend their way.<br />
On right and left by folding doors enclos'd,<br />
Are halls where gods of rank and power are set;<br />
Plebeians far and wide their place select:<br />
More potent deities, in heaven most bright,<br />
Full in the front possess their shining seats.<br />
This place, (might words so bold a form assume)<br />
I'd term Palatium of the lofty sky.<br />
Here in his marble niche each god was plac'd<br />
And on his eburn sceptre leaning, Jove<br />
O'er all high tower'd; the dread-inspiring locks<br />
Three times he shook; and ocean, earth, and sky,<br />
The motion felt and trembled. Then in rage<br />
The silence thus he broke:&mdash;“Not more I fear'd<br />
“Our kingdom's fate in those tempestuous times,<br />
“When monsters serpent-footed furious strove,<br />
“To clasp within their hundred arms the heavens,<br />
“Already captive deem'd. Though fierce our foe,<br />
“One race alone warr'd with us, sprung from one.<br />
“Now all must perish; all within the bounds<br />
“By Nereus circled with his roaring waves.<br />
“I swear by Styx, by those infernal streams,<br />
“Through shades slow creeping. All I could I've try'd.<br />
“But lest to parts unsound the taint should spread,<br />
“What baffles cure, the knife must lop away.<br />
“Our demi-gods we have,&mdash;we have our nymphs,<br />
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
“Our rustic deities,&mdash;our satyrs,&mdash;fawns,<br />
“And mountain sylvans&mdash;whose deserts we grant<br />
“Celestial honors claim not,&mdash;yet on earth,<br />
“By us assign'd, they safely sure should rest.<br />
“But, oh! ye sacred powers,&mdash;but oh! how safe<br />
“Are these, when fierce Lycaön plots for me!<br />
“Me! whom the thunders and yourselves obey?”<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud murmurs fill the skies&mdash;swift vengeance all<br />
With eager voice demand. When impious hands<br />
With Cæsar's blood th' immortal fame of Rome,<br />
Rag'd to extinguish&mdash;all the world aghast,<br />
With horror shook, and trembled through its frame.<br />
Nor was thy subjects' loyalty to thee<br />
More sweet, Augustus, than was theirs to Jove.<br />
His hand and voice, to still their noise he rais'd:<br />
Their clamors loud were hush'd, all silence kept;<br />
When thus the thunderer ends his angry tale:<br />
“Dismiss your care, his punishment is o'er;<br />
“But hear his crimes, and hear his well-earn'd fate.<br />
“Of human vice the fame had reach'd mine ear,<br />
“With hop'd exaggeration; gliding down,<br />
“From proud Olympus' brow, I veil'd the god,<br />
“And rov'd the world in human form around.<br />
“'Twere long to tell what turpitude I saw<br />
“On every side, for rumor far fell short,<br />
“Of what I witness'd. Through the dusky woods<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
“Of Mænalus I pass'd, where savage lurk<br />
“Fierce monsters; o'er the cold Lycean hill,<br />
“With pine-trees waving; and Cyllené's height.<br />
“Thence to th' Arcadian monarch's roof I came,<br />
“As dusky twilight drew on sable night.<br />
“Gave signs a god approach'd. The people crowd<br />
“In adoration: but Lycaön turns<br />
“Their reverence and piety to scorn.<br />
“Then said,&mdash;not hard the task to ascertain,<br />
“If god or mortal, by unerring test:<br />
“And plots to slay me when oppress'd with sleep.<br />
“Such proof his soul well suited. Impious more,<br />
“An hostage from Molossus sent he slew;<br />
“His palpitating members part he boil'd,<br />
“And o'er the glowing embers roasted part:<br />
“These on the board he serves. My vengeful flames<br />
“Consume his roof;&mdash;for his deserts, o'erwhelm<br />
“His household gods. Lycaön trembling fled<br />
“And gain'd the silent country; loud he howl'd,<br />
“And strove in vain to speak; his ravenous mouth<br />
“Still thirsts for slaughter; on the harmless flocks<br />
“His fury rages, as it wont on man:<br />
“Blood glads him still; his vest is shaggy hair;<br />
“His arms sink down to legs; a wolf he stands.<br />
“Yet former traits his visage still retains;<br />
“Grey still his hair; and cruel still his look;<br />
“His eyes still glisten; savage all his form.<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
“Thus one house perish'd, but not one alone<br />
“The fate deserves. Wherever earth extends,<br />
“The fierce Erinnys reigns; men seem conspir'd<br />
“In impious bond to sin; and all shall feel<br />
“The scourge they merit: fixt is my decree.”<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part loud applaud his words, and feed his rage;<br />
The rest assent in silence; yet to all,<br />
Man's loss seems grievous; anxious all enquire<br />
What form shall earth of him depriv'd assume?<br />
Who then shall incense to their altars bring?<br />
And if those rich and fertile lands he means<br />
A spoil for beasts ferocious? Their despair<br />
He bade them banish, and in him confide<br />
For what the future needed; held them forth<br />
The promise of a race unlike the first;<br />
Originating from a wonderous stock.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now his lightenings were already shot,<br />
And earth in flames, but that a fire so vast,<br />
He fear'd might reach Olympus, and consume<br />
The heavenly axis. Also call'd to mind<br />
What fate had doom'd, that all in future times<br />
By fire should perish, earth, and sea, and heaven;<br />
And all th' unwieldy fabric of the world<br />
Should waste to nought. The Cyclops' labor'd bolts<br />
Aside he laid. A different vengeance now,<br />
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
To drench with rains from every part of heaven,<br />
And whelm mankind beneath the rising waves,<br />
Pleas'd more th' immortal. Straightway close he pent<br />
The dry north-east, and every blast to showers<br />
Adverse, in caves Æolian, and unbarr'd<br />
The cell of Notus. Notus rushes forth<br />
On pinions dropping rain; his horrid face<br />
A pitchy cloud conceals; pregnant with showers<br />
His beard; and waters from his grey hairs flow:<br />
Mists on his forehead sit; in dews dissolv'd<br />
His arms and bosom, seem to melt away.<br />
With broad hands seizing on the pendent clouds<br />
He press'd them&mdash;with a mighty crash they burst,<br />
And thick and constant floods from heaven pour down.<br />
Iris meantime, in various robe array'd,<br />
Collects the waters and supplies the clouds.<br />
Prostrate the harvest lies, the tiller's hopes<br />
Turn to despair. The labors of an year,<br />
A long, long year, without their fruit are spent.<br />
Nor Jove's own heaven his anger could suffice,<br />
His brother brings him his auxiliar waves.<br />
He calls the rivers,&mdash;at their monarch's call<br />
His roof they enter, and in brief he speaks:<br />
“Few words we need, pour each his utmost strength,<br />
“The cause demands it; ope' your fountains wide,<br />
“Sweep every mound before you, and let gush<br />
“Your furious waters with unshorten'd reins.”<br />
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
He bids&mdash;the watery gods retire,&mdash;break up<br />
Their narrow springs, and furious tow'rd the main<br />
Their waters roll: himself his trident rears<br />
And smites the earth; earth trembles at the stroke,<br />
Yawns wide her bosom, and upon the land<br />
A flood disgorges. Wide outspread the streams<br />
Rush o'er the open fields;&mdash;uproot the trees;<br />
Sweep harvests, flocks, and men;&mdash;nor houses stood;<br />
Nor household gods, asylums hereto safe.<br />
Where strong-built edifice its walls oppos'd<br />
Unlevell'd in the ruin, high above<br />
Its roof the billows mounted, and its towers<br />
Totter'd, beneath the watery gulf oppress'd.<br />
Nor land nor sea their ancient bounds maintain'd,<br />
For all around was sea, sea without shore.<br />
This seeks a mountain's top, that gains a skiff,<br />

O'er fields of corn one sails, or 'bove the roofs<br />
Of towns immerg'd;&mdash;another in the elm<br />
Seizes th' intangled fish. Perchance in meads<br />
The anchor oft is thrown, and oft the keel<br />
Tears the subjacent vine-tree. Where were wont<br />
The nimble goats to crop the tender grass<br />
Unwieldy sea-calves roll. The Nereid nymphs,<br />
With wonder, groves, and palaces, and towns,<br />
Beneath the waves behold. By dolphins now<br />
The woods are tenanted, who furious smite<br />
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
The boughs, and shake the strong oak by their blows.<br />
Swims with the flock the wolf; and swept along,<br />
Tigers and tawny lions strive in vain.<br />
Now not his thundering strength avails the boar;<br />
Nor, borne away, the fleet stag's slender limbs:<br />
And land, long sought in vain, to rest her feet,<br />
The wandering bird draws in her weary wings,<br />
And drops into the waves, whose uncheck'd roll<br />
The hills have drown'd; and with un'custom'd surge<br />
Foam on the mountain tops. Of man the most<br />
They swallow'd; whom their fierce irruption spar'd,<br />
By hunger perish'd in their bleak retreat.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between th' Aönian and Actæian lands<br />
Lies Phocis; fruitful were the Phocian fields<br />
While fields they were, but now o'erwhelm'd, they form<br />
A region only of the wide-spread main.<br />
Here stands Parnassus with his forked top,<br />
Above the clouds high-towering to the stars.<br />
To this Deucalion with his consort driven<br />
O'er ridgy billows in his bark clung close;<br />
For all was sea beside. There bend they down;<br />
The nymphs, and mountain gods adore, and she<br />

No man more upright than himself had liv'd;<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Jove beheld a mighty lake expand<br />
Where late was earth, and from the swarming crowds<br />
But one man sav'd&mdash;of woman only one:<br />
Both guiltless,&mdash;pious both. He chas'd the clouds<br />
And bade the dry north-east to drive the showers<br />
Far distant, and display the earth to heaven,<br />
And unto earth the skies. The ocean's rage<br />
Remains no more. Mild Neptune lays aside<br />
His three-fork'd weapon, and his surges smoothes;<br />
Then calls blue Triton from the dark profound.<br />
Above the waves the god his shoulders rears,<br />
With inbred purple ting'd: He bids him sound<br />
His shelly trump, and back the billows call;<br />
And rivers to their banks again remand.<br />
The trump he seizes,&mdash;broad above it wreath'd<br />
From narrow base;&mdash;the trump whose piercing blast<br />
From east to west resounds through every shore.<br />
This to his mouth the watery-bearded god<br />
Applies, and breathes within the stern command.<br />
All hear the sound, or waves of earth or sea,<br />
And all who hear obey. Sea finds a shore;<br />
Floods flow within their channels; rivers sink;<br />
Hills lift their heads; and as the waves decrease,<br />
In numerous islets solid earth appears.<br />
A tedious time elaps'd, and now the woods<br />
Display'd their leafless summits, and their boughs<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
Heavy with mud. At length the world restor'd<br />
Deucalion saw, but empty all and void;<br />
Deep silence reigning through th' expansive waste:<br />
Tears gush'd while thus his Pyrrha he address'd:<br />
“O sister! wife! O woman sole preserv'd!&mdash;<br />
“By nature, kindred, and the marriage-bed,<br />
“To me most closely join'd. Now nearer still<br />
“By mutual perils. We, of all the earth<br />
“Beheld by Sol in his diurnal course,<br />
“We two alone remain. The mighty deep<br />
“Entombs the rest. Nor sure our safety yet;<br />
“Still hang the clouds dark louring. Wretched wife,<br />
“What if preserv'd alone? What hadst thou done<br />
“Of me bereft? How singly borne the shock?<br />
“Where found condolement in thy load of grief?<br />
“For me,&mdash;and trust, my dearest wife, my words,&mdash;<br />
“Hadst thou amidst the billows been ingulph'd,<br />
“Me also had they swallow'd. Oh! for power<br />
“To form mankind, as once my father did,<br />
“And in the shapen earth true souls infuse!<br />
“In us rests human race, so will the gods,<br />
“A sample only of mankind we live.”<br />
He spoke and Pyrrha's tears join'd his. To heaven<br />
They raise their hands in prayer, and straight resolve<br />
To ask through oracles divine its aid.<br />
Nor long delay. Quick to Cephisus' streams<br />
They hasten; muddy still Cephisus flows,<br />
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
Yet not beyond its wonted boundaries swol'n.<br />
Libations thence they lift, and o'er their heads<br />
And garments cast the sprinklings;&mdash;then their steps<br />
To Themis' temple bend. The roof they found<br />
With filthy moss o'ergrown;&mdash;the altars cold.<br />
Prone on the steps they fell, and trembling kiss'd<br />
The gelid stones, and thus preferr'd their words:<br />
“If righteous prayers can move the heavenly mind,<br />
“And soften harsh resolves, and soothe the rage<br />
“Of great immortals, say, O Themis, say,<br />
“How to the world mankind shall be restor'd;<br />
“And grant, most merciful, in our distress<br />
“Thy potent aid.” The goddess heard their words,<br />
And instant gave reply. “The temple leave,<br />
“Ungird your garments, veil your heads, and throw<br />
“Behind your backs your mighty mother's bones.”<br />
Astonish'd long they stood! and Pyrrha first<br />
The silence broke; the oracle's behest<br />
Refusing to obey; and earnest pray'd,<br />
With trembling tongue for pardon for her sin:<br />
Her mother's shade to violate she dreads,<br />
Her bones thus rudely flinging. But meantime<br />
Deep in their minds, in dark mysterious veil<br />
Obscurely hid, the sentence they revolve.<br />
At length Deucalion sooths his wife with words<br />
Of cheering import: “Right, if I divine,<br />
“No impious deed the deity desires:<br />
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
“Earth is our mighty mother, and her bones<br />
“The stony rocks within her;&mdash;these behind<br />
“Our backs to cast, the oracle commands.”<br />
With joy th' auspicious augury she hears,<br />
But joy with doubt commingled, both so much<br />
The heavenly words distrust; yet still they hope<br />
The essay cannot harm. The temple left,<br />
Their heads they cover, and their vests unbind;<br />
And o'er their heads as order'd heave the stones.<br />
The stones&mdash;(incredible! unless the fact<br />
Tradition sanction'd doubtless) straight began<br />
To lose their rugged firmness,&mdash;and anon,<br />
To soften,&mdash;and when soft a form assume.<br />
Next as they grew in size, they felt infus'd<br />
A nature mild,&mdash;their form resembled man!<br />
But incorrectly: marble so appears,<br />
Rough hewn to form a statue, ere the hand<br />
Completes the shape. What liquid was, and moist,<br />
With earthy atoms mixt, soft flesh became;<br />
Parts solid and unbending chang'd to bone;<br />
In name unalter'd, veins the same remain'd.<br />
Thus by the gods' beneficent decree,<br />
And brief the change, the stones Deucalion threw,<br />
A manly shape assum'd; but females sprung<br />
From those by Pyrrha cast behind; and hence<br />
A patient, hard, laborious race we prove,<br />
And shew the source, by actions, whence we sprung.<br />

Swell'd up their oozy loads to meet the beams:<br />
And nourish'd by earth's vivifying soil,<br />
The fruitful elements of life increas'd,<br />
As in a mother's womb; and in a while<br />
Assum'd a certain shape. So when the floods<br />
Of seven-mouth'd Nile desert the moisten'd fields,<br />
And to their ancient channels bring their streams,<br />
The soft mud fries beneath the scorching sun;<br />
And midst the fresh-turn'd earth unnumber'd forms<br />
The tiller finds: some scarcely half conceiv'd;<br />
Imperfect some, their bodies wanting limbs:<br />
And oft he beings sees with parts alive,<br />
The rest a clod of earth: for where with heat<br />
Due moisture kindly mixes, life will spring:<br />
From these in concord all things are produc'd.<br />
Though fire with water strives; yet vapour warm,<br />
Discordant mixture, gives a birth to all.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus when the earth, with filthy ooze bespread<br />
From the late deluge, felt the blazing sun;<br />
His burning heat productive caus'd spring forth<br />
A countless race of beings. Part appear'd<br />
In forms before well-known; the rest a group<br />
Of monsters strange. Then, but unwilling, she<br />

Produc'd terrific Python, serpent huge!<br />
A mighty mountain with his bulk he hid;<br />
A plague unknown, the new-born race to scare.<br />
The quiver-shoulder'd god, unus'd before<br />
His arms to launch, save on the flying deer,<br />
Or roebuck fleet, the horrid monster slew:<br />
A thousand arrows in his sides he fix'd,<br />
His quiver's store exhausting; through the wounds<br />
Gush'd the black poison. To contending games,<br />
Hence instituted for the serpent slain,<br />
The glorious action to preserve through times<br />
Succeeding, he the name of Pythian gave.<br />
And here the youth who bore the palm away<br />
By wrestling, racing, or in chariot swift,<br />
With beechen bough was crown'd. Nor yet was known<br />
The laurel's leaf: Apollo's brows, with hair<br />
Deck'd graceful, no peculiar branches bound.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penæian Daphne first his bosom charm'd;<br />
No casual flame but plann'd by Love's revenge.<br />
Him, Ph&oelig;bus flush'd with conquest late obtain'd,<br />
His bow saw bend, and thus exclaim'd in taunt:<br />
“Lascivious boy! How ill with thee assort<br />
“Those warlike arms?&mdash;how much my shoulders more<br />
“Beseem the load, whose arm can deadly wounds<br />
“In furious beasts, and every foe infix!<br />
“I who but now huge Python have o'erthrown;<br />
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;24]</span>
“Swol'n with a thousand darts; his mighty bulk<br />
“Whole acres covering with pestiferous weight?<br />
“Content in vulgar hearts thy torch to flame,<br />
“To me the bow's superior glory leave.”<br />
Then Venus' son: “O Ph&oelig;bus, nought thy dart<br />
“Evades, nor thou canst 'scape the force of mine:<br />
“To thee as others yield,&mdash;so much my fame<br />
“Must ever thine transcend.” Thus spoke the boy,<br />
And lightly mounting, cleaves the yielding air<br />
With beating wings, and on Parnassus' top<br />
Umbrageous rests. There from his quiver drew<br />
Two darts of different power:&mdash;this chases love;<br />
And that desire enkindles; form'd of gold<br />
It glistens, ending in a point acute:<br />
Blunt is the first, tipt with a leaden load;<br />
Which Love in Daphne's tender breast infix'd.<br />
The sharper through Apollo's heart he drove,<br />
And through his nerves and bones;&mdash;instant he loves:<br />
She flies of love the name. In shady woods,<br />
And spoils of captive beasts alone she joys;<br />
To copy Dian' emulous; her hair<br />
In careless tresses form'd, a fillet bound.<br />
By numbers sought,&mdash;averse alike to all;<br />
Impatient of their suit, through forests wild,<br />
And groves, in maiden ignorance she roams;<br />
Nor cares for Cupid, nor hymeneal rites,<br />
Nor soft connubial joys. Oft cry'd her sire;<br />
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
“My Daphne, you should bring to me a son;<br />
“From you, my child, I hope for grandsons too.”<br />
But she detesting wedlock as a crime,<br />
(Suffus'd her features with a bashful glow)<br />
Around his aged neck, her beauteous arms,<br />
Winds blandishing, and cries, “O sire, most dear!<br />
“One favor grant,&mdash;perpetual to enjoy<br />
“My virgin purity;&mdash;the mighty Jove<br />
“The same indulgence has to Dian' given.”<br />
Thy sire complies;&mdash;but that too beauteous face,<br />
And lovely form, thy anxious wish oppose:<br />
Apollo loves thee;&mdash;to thy bed aspires;&mdash;<br />
And looks with anxious hopes, his wish to gain:<br />
Futurity, by him for once unseen.<br />
As the light stubble when the ears are shorn,<br />
The flames consume: as hedges blaze on high<br />
From torches by the traveller closely held,<br />
Or heedless flung, when morning gilds the world:<br />
So flaming burnt the god;&mdash;so blaz'd his breast,<br />
And with fond hopes his vain desires he fed.<br />
Her tresses careless flowing o'er her neck<br />
He view'd, and, “Oh! how beauteous, deck'd with care,”<br />
Exclaim'd: her eyes which shone like brilliant fire,<br />
Or sparkling stars, he sees; and sees her lips;<br />
Unsated with the sight, he burns to touch:<br />
Admires her fingers, and her hands, her arms,<br />
Half to the shoulder naked:&mdash;what he sees<br />
<a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;26]</span>
Though beauteous, what is hid he deems more fair.<br />
Fleet as the wind, her fearful flight she wings,<br />
Nor stays his fond recalling words to hear:<br />
“Daughter of Peneus, stay! no foe pursues,&mdash;<br />
“Stay, beauteous nymph!&mdash;so flies the lamb the wolf;<br />
“The stag the lion;&mdash;so on trembling wings<br />
“The dove avoids the eagle:&mdash;these are foes,<br />
“But love alone me urges to pursue.<br />
“Ah me! then, shouldst thou fall,&mdash;or prickly thorns<br />
“Wound thy fair legs,&mdash;and I the cause of pain!&mdash;<br />
“Rough is the road thou runnest; slack, I pray,<br />
“Thy speed;&mdash;I swear to follow not so fast.<br />
“But hear who loves thee;&mdash;no rough mountain swain;<br />
“No shepherd;&mdash;none in raiments rugged clad,<br />
“Tending the lowing herds: rash thoughtless nymph,<br />
“Thou fly'st thou know'st not whom, and therefore fly'st!<br />
“O'er Delphos' lands, and Tenedos I sway,<br />
“And Claros, and the Pataræan realms.&mdash;<br />
“My sire is Jove. To me are all things known,<br />
“Or present, past, or future. Taught by me<br />
“Melodious sounds poetic numbers grace.&mdash;<br />
“Sure is my dart, but one more sure I feel<br />
“Lodg'd in this bosom; strange to love before.&mdash;<br />
“Medicine me hails inventor; through the world<br />
“My help is call'd for; unto me is known<br />
“The powers of plants and herbs:&mdash;ah! hapless I,<br />
“Nor plants, nor herbs, afford a cure for love;<br />
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
“Nor arts which all relieve, relieve their lord.”<br />
All this, and more:&mdash;but Daphne fearful fled,<br />
And left his speech unfinish'd. Lovely then<br />
She running seem'd;&mdash;her limbs the breezes bar'd;<br />
Her flying raiment floated on the gale;<br />
Her careless tresses to the light air stream'd;<br />
Her flight increas'd her beauty. Now no more<br />
The god to waste his courteous words endures,<br />
But urg'd by love himself, with swifter pace<br />
Her footsteps treads: the rapid greyhound so,<br />
When in the open field the hare he spies,<br />
Trusts to his legs for prey,&mdash;as she for flight;<br />
And now he snaps, and now he thinks to hold,<br />
And brushes with his outstretch'd nose her heels;&mdash;<br />
She trembling, half in doubt, or caught or no,<br />
Springs from his jaws, and mocks his touching mouth.<br />
Thus fled the virgin and the god;&mdash;he fleet<br />
Through hope, and she through fear,&mdash;but wing'd by love<br />
More rapid flew Apollo;&mdash;spurning rest,<br />
Approach'd her close behind, and panting breath'd<br />
Upon her floating tresses. Pale with dread,<br />
Her strength exhausted in the lengthen'd flight,<br />
Old Peneus' streams she saw, and loud exclaim'd:&mdash;<br />
“O sire, assist me, if within thy streams<br />
“Divinity abides. Let earth this form,<br />
“Too comely for my peace, quick swallow up;<br />
“Or change those beauties to an harmless shape.”<br />
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;28]</span>
Her prayer scarce ended, when her lovely limbs<br />
A numbness felt; a tender rind enwraps<br />
Her beauteous bosom; from her head shoots up<br />
Her hair in leaves; in branches spread her arms;<br />
Her feet but now so swift, cleave to the earth<br />
With roots immoveable; her face at last<br />
The summit forms; her bloom the same remains.<br />
Still loves the god the tree, and on the trunk<br />
His right hand placing, feels her breast yet throb,<br />
Beneath the new-grown bark: around the boughs,<br />
As yet her limbs, his clasping arms he throws;<br />
And burning kisses on the wood imprints.<br />
The wood his lips repels. Then thus the god:&mdash;<br />
“O laurel, though to be my bride deny'd,<br />
“Yet shalt thou be my tree; my temples bind;<br />
“My lyre and quiver shalt thou still adorn:<br />
“The brows of Latian conquerors shalt thou grace,<br />
“When the glad people sing triumphant hymns,<br />
“And the long pomp the capitol ascends.<br />
“A faithful guard before Augustus' gates,<br />
“On each side hung;&mdash;the sturdy oak between.<br />
“And as perpetual youth adorns my head<br />
“With locks unshorn, thou also still shalt bear<br />
“Thy leafy honors in perpetual green.”<br />
Apollo ended, and the laurel bow'd<br />
Her verdant summit as her grateful head.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within Æmonia lies a grove, inclos'd<br />
By steep and lofty hills on every side:<br />
'Tis Tempé call'd. From lowest Pindus pour'd<br />

Thick clouds of smoke, and dark and vapoury mists<br />
The violent falls produce, sprinkling the tops<br />
Of proudest forests with the plenteous dew;<br />
And distant parts astounding with the roar.<br />
Here holds the watery deity his throne;&mdash;<br />

Here Spercheus came, whose banks with poplars wave;<br />
Rapid Enipeus; Apidanus slow;<br />
Amphrysos gently flowing; Æäs mild;<br />
And other streams which wind their various course,<br />
Till in the sea their weary wanderings end,<br />
By natural bent directed. Absent sole<br />

Now Lerna's pastures, and Lyrcæa's lands<br />
With trees thick-planted, far behind were left;<br />
When with a sudden mist the god conceal'd<br />
The wide-spread earth, and stopp'd her eager flight;<br />
And in his arms the struggling maid compress'd.<br />
Meantime did Juno cast her eyes below,<br />
The floating clouds surpris'd to see produce<br />
A night-like shade amidst so bright a day.<br />
No common clouds, from streams exhal'd, she knew;<br />
Nor misty vapours from the humid earth.<br />
Suspicions rise; her sharpness oft had caught<br />
Her amorous husband in his thefts of love.<br />
She search'd around the sky, its lord explor'd,&mdash;<br />
But not in heaven he sate;&mdash;then loud exclaim'd:<br />

Prepar'd already, Jove the nymph had chang'd,<br />

Unwilling Juno prais'd; and whence she came,<br />
And who her owner asks; and of what herd?<br />
Her prying art, as witless of the truth,<br />
To baffle, from the earth he feigns her sprung;<br />
And straight Saturnia begs the beauteous gift.<br />
Embarrass'd now he stands,&mdash;the nymph to leave<br />
Abandon'd, were too cruel;&mdash;to deny<br />
His wife, suspicious: shame compliance urg'd;<br />
Love strong dissuaded: love had vanquish'd shame,<br />
Save that a paltry cow to her refus'd,<br />
Associate of his race and bed, he fear'd<br />
More than a cow the goddess would suspect.<br />
Her rival now she holds; but anxious, still<br />
She Jove distrusts, and fears her prize to lose;<br />
Nor safe she deem'd her, till to Argus' care<br />
Committed. Round the jailor's watchful head<br />
An hundred eyes were set. Two clos'd in turn;<br />
The rest with watchful care, kept cautious guard.<br />
Howe'er he stands, on Iö still he looks;<br />
His face averse, yet still his eyes behold.<br />
By day she pastures, but beneath the earth<br />
When Ph&oelig;bus sinks, he drags her to the stall,<br />
And binds with cords her undeserving neck.<br />

Arbutus' leaves, and bitter herbs her food:<br />
Her wretched bed is oft the cold damp earth;<br />
A strawy couch deny'd:&mdash;the muddy stream<br />
Her constant drink: when suppliant she would raise<br />
Her arms to Argus, arms to raise were none.<br />
To moan she tries; loud bellowings echo wide,&mdash;<br />
She starts and trembles at her voice's roar.<br />
Now to the banks she comes where oft she'd play'd,&mdash;<br />
The banks of Inachus, and in his streams<br />
Her new-form'd horns beheld;&mdash;in wild affright<br />
From them she strove, and from herself to fly.<br />
Her sister Naïads know her not, nor he<br />
Griev'd Inachus, his long-lost daughter knows.<br />
But she her sisters and her sire pursues;<br />
Invites their touch, as wondering they caress.<br />
Old Inachus the gather'd herbs presents;<br />
She licks his hands, and presses with her lips<br />
His dear paternal fingers. Tears flow quick,<br />
And could words follow she would ask his aid;<br />
And speak her name, and lamentable state.<br />
Marks for her words she form'd, which in the dust<br />
Trac'd by her hoof, disclos'd her mournful change.<br />
“Ah wretch!” her sire exclaim'd, “unhappy wretch!”<br />
And o'er the weeping heifer's snowy neck,<br />
His arms he threw, and round her horns he hung<br />
With sobs redoubled:&mdash;“Art thou then, my child,<br />
“Through earth's extent so sought? Ah! less my grief,<br />

“To find thee not, than thus transform'd to find!<br />
“But dumb thou art, nor with responsive words,<br />
“Me cheerest. From thy deep chest sighs alone<br />
“Thou utterest, and loud lowings to my words:<br />

“Must still corrode me; Lethé's gate is clos'd.”<br />
Thus griev'd the god, when starry Argus tore<br />
His charge away, and to a distant mead<br />
Drove her to pasture;&mdash;he a lofty hill's<br />
Commanding prospect chose, and seated there<br />
View'd all around alike on every side.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now heaven's ruler could no more contain,<br />
To see the sorrows Iö felt:&mdash;he calls<br />
His son, of brightest Pleiäd mother born,<br />
And bids him quickly compass Argus' death.<br />
Instant around his heels his wings he binds;<br />
His rod somniferous grasps; nor leaves his cap.<br />
Accoutred thus, from native heights he springs,<br />
And lights on earth; removes his cap; his wings<br />
Unlooses; and his wand alone retains:<br />
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;34]</span>
Through devious paths with this, a shepherd now,<br />
A flock he drives of goats, and tunes his pipe<br />
Of reeds constructed. Argus hears the sound,<br />
Junonian guard, and captivated cries,&mdash;<br />
“Come, stranger, sit with me upon this mount:<br />
“Nor for thy flock more fertile pasture grows,<br />
“Than round this spot;&mdash;and here the shade thou seest<br />
“To shepherds' ease inviting.”&mdash;Hermes sate,<br />
And with his converse stay'd declining day.<br />
Long he discours'd, and anxious strove to lull<br />
With music sweet, the all-observant eyes;<br />
But long he strove in vain: soft slumber's bonds<br />
Argus opposes;&mdash;of his numerous lights,<br />
Part sleep, but others jealous watch his charge.<br />
And now he questions whence the pipe was form'd,<br />
The pipe but new-discover'd to the world.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thus the god:&mdash;“A lovely Naiäd nymph,<br />
“With bleak Arcadia's Hamadryads nurs'd,<br />
“And on Nonacriné for beauty fam'd<br />
“Was Syrinx. Oft the satyrs wild she fled;<br />
“Nor these alone, but every god that roves<br />
“In shady forests, or in fertile fields.<br />
“Dian' she follows, and her virgin life.<br />
“Like Dian' cinctur'd, she might Dian' seem,<br />
“Save that a golden bow the goddess bears;<br />
“The nymph a bow of horn: yet still to most<br />
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
“Mistake was easy. From Lycæum's height,<br />
“His head encompass'd with the pointed pine,<br />
“Returning, her the lustful Pan espy'd,<br />
“And cry'd:&mdash;Fair virgin grant a god's request,&mdash;<br />
“A god who burns to wed thee. Here he stays.<br />
“Through pathless forests flies the nymph, and scorns<br />
“His warm intreaties, till the gravelly stream<br />
“Of Ladon, smoothly winding, she beheld.<br />
“The waves impede her flight. She earnest prays<br />
“Her sister-nymphs her human form to change.<br />
“Now thinks the sylvan god his clasping arms<br />
“Inclose her, whilst he grasps but marshy reeds.&mdash;<br />
“He mournful sighs; the light reeds catch his breath,<br />
“And soft reverberate the plaintive sound.<br />
“The dulcet movement charms th' enraptur'd god,<br />
“Who,&mdash;thus forever shall we join,&mdash;exclaims!<br />
“With wax combin'd th' unequal reeds he forms<br />
“A pipe, which still the virgin's name retains.”<br />
While thus the god, he every eye beheld<br />
Weigh'd heavy, sink in sleep, and stopp'd his tale.<br />
His magic rod o'er every lid he draws,<br />
His sleep confirming, and with crooked blade<br />
Severs his nodding head, and down the mount<br />
The bloody ruin hurls,&mdash;the craggy rock<br />
With gore besmearing. Low, thou Argus liest!<br />
Extinct thy hundred lights; one night obscure<br />
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;36]</span>
Eclipsing all. But Juno seiz'd the rays,<br />
And on the plumage of her favor'd bird,<br />
In gaudy pride, the starry gems she plac'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With furious ire she flam'd, and instant sent<br />
The dread Erinnys to the Argive maid.<br />
Before her eyes, within her breast she dwelt<br />
A secret torment, and in terror drove<br />
Her exil'd through the world. 'Twas thou, O Nile!<br />
Her tedious wandering ended. On thy banks<br />
Weary'd she kneel'd, and on her back, supine<br />
Her neck she lean'd:&mdash;her sad face to the skies,<br />
What could she more?&mdash;she lifted. Unto Jove<br />
By groans, and tears, and mournful lows she plain'd,<br />
And begg'd her woes might end. The mighty god<br />
Around his consort's neck embracing hung.<br />
And pray'd her wrath might finish. “Fear no more<br />
“A rival love, in her,” he said, “to see;”<br />
And bade the Stygian streams his words record.<br />
Appeas'd the goddess, Iö straight resumes<br />
Her wonted shape, as lovely as before.<br />
The rough hair flies; the crooked horns are shed;<br />
Her visual orbits narrow; and her mouth<br />
In size contracts; her arms and hands return;<br />
Parted in five small nails her hoofs are lost:<br />
Nought of the lovely heifer now remains,<br />
Save the bright splendor. On her feet erect<br />
<a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;37]</span>
With two now only furnish'd, stands the maid.<br />
To speak she fears, lest bellowing sounds should break,<br />
And timid tries her long-forgotten words.<br />
Of mighty fame a goddess now, she hears<br />
Of nations linen-clad the pious prayers.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then bore she Epaphus, whose birth deriv'd<br />
From mighty Jove, his temples through the land,<br />
An equal worship with his mother's claim.<br />
Him Phaëton, bright Ph&oelig;bus' youthful son,<br />
In years and spirit equall'd,&mdash;whose proud boasts,<br />
To all his sire preferring, Iö's son<br />
Thus check'd: “O simple! thee thy mother's arts<br />
“To ought persuade. A feigned sire thou boast'st.”<br />
Deep blush'd the youth, but shame his rage repress'd,<br />
And each reproach to Clymené he bore.<br />
“This too,” he says, “O mother, irks me more,<br />
“That I so bold, so fierce, urg'd no defence:<br />
“Which shame is greater? that they dare accuse,<br />
“Or that accus'd, we cannot prove them false?<br />
“Do thou my mother,&mdash;if from heaven indeed<br />
“Descent I claim,&mdash;prove from what stock I spring.<br />
“My race divine assert.” He said,&mdash;and flung<br />
Around her neck his arms; and by his life,<br />
The life of Merops, and his sisters' hopes<br />
Of nuptial bliss, adjures her to obtain<br />
Proofs of his birth celestial. Prayers like these<br />
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;38]</span>
The mother doubtless mov'd;&mdash;and rage no less<br />
To hear the defamation. Up to heaven<br />
Her arms she raises, gazing on the sun,<br />
And cries,&mdash;“My child! by yon bright rays I swear<br />
“In brilliance glittering, which now hear and view,<br />
“Our every word and action&mdash;thou art sprung<br />
“From him, the sun thou see'st;&mdash;the sun who rules<br />
“With tempering sway the seasons:&mdash;If untrue<br />
“My words, let me his light no more behold!<br />
“Nor long the toil to seek thy father's dome,<br />
“His palace whence he rises borders close<br />
“On our land's confines.&mdash;If thou dar'st the task,<br />
“Go forth, and from himself thy birth enquire.”<br />
Elate to hear her words, the youth departs<br />
Instant, and all the sky in mind he grasps.<br />
Through Æthiopia's regions swiftly went,<br />
With India plac'd beneath the burning zone:<br />
And quickly reach'd his own paternal east.<br />

</h2>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By towering columns bright with burnish'd gold,<br />
And fiery gems, which blaz'd their light around,<br />
Upborne, the palace stood. The lofty roof<br />
With ivory smooth incas'd. The folding doors,<br />
Of silver shone, but much by sculpture grac'd,<br />
For Vulcan there with curious hand had carv'd<br />
The ocean girding in the land; the land;<br />
And heaven o'ershadowing: here cerulean gods<br />
Sport in the waves, grim Triton with his shell;<br />
Proteus shape-changing; and Ægeon huge,&mdash;<br />
His mighty arms upon the large broad backs<br />
Of whales hard pressing: Doris and her nymphs:<br />
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;42]</span>
Some sportive swimming; on a rocky seat<br />
Some their green tresses drying; others borne<br />
By fish swift-gliding: nor the same all seem'd,<br />
Yet sister-like a close resembling look<br />
Each face pervaded. Earth her natives bore,<br />
Mankind;&mdash;and woods, and cities, there were seen;<br />
Wild beasts, and streams, and nymphs, and rural gods.<br />
'Bove all the bright display of heaven was hung&mdash;<br />
Six signs celestial o'er each portal grav'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daring youth, the steep ascent attain'd,<br />
O'erstepp'd the threshold of his dubious sire,<br />
And hasty rush'd to meet paternal eyes;<br />
But sudden stay'd: so fierce a blaze of light<br />
No nearer he sustain'd. In purple clad,<br />
The god a regal emerald throne upheld;<br />
Encircled round by hours which space the day;<br />
By days themselves; and ages, months, and years.<br />
Crown'd with a flowery garland Spring appear'd:<br />
Chaplets of grain the swarthy brows adorn'd<br />
Of naked Summer: smear'd with trodden grapes<br />
Stood Autumn: icy Winter fill'd the groupe;&mdash;<br />
Snow-white his shaggy locks. Sol from the midst<br />
His eyes all-seeing glanc'd upon the youth,<br />
Startled and trembling at the wonderous sight;<br />
And cried:&mdash;“What brings my Phaëton, my son,<br />
“Whose sire shall ne'er disclaim him? tell me now,<br />
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;43]</span>
“What here thou seekest?” Thus the youth replies:&mdash;<br />
“O father, Ph&oelig;bus, universal light!<br />
“If justly, I thy honor'd name may use,<br />
“Nor proudly boasting Clymené conceals<br />
“A crime by falshood; grant paternal signs,<br />
“The world convincing that from thee I spring;<br />
“Reproachful doubts erasing from my mind.”<br />
He said;&mdash;the sire the glittering rays removes<br />
That blaz'd around his head,&mdash;invites him nigh,<br />
And thus embracing:&mdash;“Proud I own thee, son,<br />
“For all is true by Clymené disclos'd.<br />
“If still thou doubtest, name the gift thou lik'st,&mdash;<br />
“That shalt thou have; for that will I bestow.<br />
“Ye streams unseen, which hear celestial oaths<br />
“My vows attest!” But scarce had Ph&oelig;bus spoke,<br />
When Phaëton, the fiery car demands,&mdash;<br />
Demands his sway the winged-footed steeds<br />
One day should suffer. Soon the solemn oath<br />
Ph&oelig;bus lamented: three times mournful shook<br />
His glorious tresses and in sorrow cry'd&mdash;<br />
“Would I could yet deny thee!&mdash;O my son!<br />
“All else with gladness will I hear thee ask;&mdash;<br />
“List to persuasion,&mdash;perseverance sure<br />
“Will risk thy ruin. Phaëton, my child!<br />
“The task thou seek'st is arduous; far unfit<br />
“For those weak arms, and age so immature.<br />
“Mortal,&mdash;thou would'st a seat immortal press.<br />
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;44]</span>
“Ignorant of grasping more than all the gods<br />
“Attempt to manage. Every power we grant<br />
“Diverse excels; but I of all the gods,<br />
“Have force in that igniferous car to stand.<br />
“Ev'n Jove, the ruler of Olympus vast,<br />
“Whose right hand terrible fierce lightenings hurls,<br />
“This chariot never rul'd: and who than Jove,<br />
“More mighty deem we? Steep the first ascent,<br />
“The fresh steeds clamber up the height with pain:<br />
“High in mid heaven arriv'd, to view beneath<br />
“Ocean and earth, oft strikes even me with fear,<br />
“And with dread palpitation shakes my breast.<br />
“Prerupt the end, and asks a firm restraint;<br />
“Tethys herself who nightly me receives,<br />
“Beneath the waves, fears oft my headlong fall.<br />
“Nor all;&mdash;the skies a constant whirling bears<br />
“In rapid motion, and the heavenly orbs<br />
“Sweep with them swift; I strive the adverse my;<br />
“Nor can th' impetuous force which whirls the rest<br />
“Bear with them me; I stem the rapid world<br />
“With force superior. Grant, the car I yield,&mdash;<br />
“Could'st thou the swift rotation of the poles<br />
“Stem nervous, nor be borne with them along?<br />
“Perchance imagination fills thy mind,<br />
“With groves, and dwellings of celestial gods,<br />
“And temples richly deck'd with offer'd gold,<br />
“Where thou shall pass. Far else;&mdash;thy journey lies,<br />
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
“Through ambushes, and savage monsters' forms.<br />
“Ev'n shouldst thou lucky not erratic stray,<br />
“Yet must thou pass the Bull's opposing horns;<br />
“The bow Hæmonian, by the Centaur bent;<br />
“The Lion's countenance grim; the Scorpion's claws<br />
“Bent cruel in a circuit large; the Crab<br />
“In lesser compass curving. Hard the task<br />
“To rule the steeds with those fierce fires inflam'd,<br />
“Within their breasts, which through their nostrils glow.<br />
“Scarce bear they my control, when mad with heat<br />
“Their high necks spurn the rein. But, oh! my son,<br />
“Beware lest I a fatal gift bestow.<br />
“Retract, while yet thou may'st, thy rash demand.<br />
“Sure tokens thou requir'st to prove thee sprung<br />
“From me,&mdash;the genuine offspring of my blood:<br />
“My anxious trembling is a token true;<br />
“Paternal terrors plainly prove the sire.<br />
“Lo! on my features fix thine eyes; as well,<br />
“I would thou could'st them place within my breast,<br />
“And view the anguish of a father's cares.<br />
“Last throw thy looks around; the riches view,<br />
“Whatever earth contains, and some demand;<br />
“Some of so many and such mighty gifts:<br />
“In heaven, or earth, or sea, 'tis undeny'd.<br />
“This only would I grant not, as its grant<br />
“Is punishment, not favor. Phaëton<br />
“Asks evil for a gift. Why, foolish boy,<br />
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
“Hang on my neck thus coaxing with thine arms?<br />
“Whate'er thou would'st, thou shalt. The Stygian streams<br />
“Have heard me swear. But make a wiser wish.”<br />
His admonition ceas'd, but all advice<br />
Was bootless: still his resolution holds;<br />
To guide the chariot still his bosom burns.<br />
The sire, his every effort vain, at length<br />
Forth to the lofty car, Vulcanian gift,<br />
Brings the rash youth. Of gold the axle shone;<br />
The pole of gold; by gold the rolling wheels<br />
Were circled; every spoke with silver bright;<br />
Upon the seat bright chrysolites display'd,<br />
With various jewels shed a dazzling light,<br />
From Sol reflected. All the high-soul'd youth<br />
Admir'd, and while he curious view'd each part,<br />
Behold Aurora from the purple east<br />
Wide throws the ruddy portals, and displays<br />
The halls with roses strewn: the starry host<br />
Fly, driven by Lucifer,&mdash;himself the last<br />
To quit his heavenly station. Sol beheld<br />
The earth and sky grow red, and Luna's horns<br />
Blunt, and prepar'd to vanish. Straight he bade<br />
The flying hours to yoke the steeds: his words<br />
The nimble goddesses obey, and lead<br />
The steeds fire-breathing from their lofty stalls,<br />
Ambrosia fed, and fix the sounding reins.<br />
Then with a sacred ointment Ph&oelig;bus smear'd<br />
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
The face of Phaëton,&mdash;unscorch'd to bear<br />
The fervid blaze; and on his head a crown<br />
Of rays he fix'd. His smother'd sighs within<br />
His anxious breast, sad presages of woe<br />
Suppressing, thus he spoke:&mdash;“If now my words<br />
“Though late, thou heedest, spare, O boy! the lash,<br />
“But tightly grasp the reins: unbid they run,<br />
“They fly; to check their flight thy labor asks.<br />
“Not through the five bright zones thy journey lies:<br />
“Obliquely winds the path, with spacious curve,<br />
“Three girdles only touching; leaving far<br />
“The pole Antarctic, and the northern Bear:<br />
“Be this thy track; there plain thou may'st discern<br />
“The marks my wheels have made. Since heaven and earth<br />
“An equal portion of my influence claim;<br />
“Press not the car too low, nor mount aloft<br />
“Near topmost heaven: there would'st thou fire the roof<br />
“Celestial;&mdash;here the earth thou would'st consume.<br />
“For safety keep the midst. Let thy right wheel<br />
“Approach the tortuous Snake not: nor thy left<br />
“Press near the Altar:&mdash;hold the midmost course.<br />
“Fortune the rest must rule; may she assist<br />
“Thy undertaking; for thy safety act<br />
“Better than thou. But more delay deny'd,<br />
“Lo! whilst I speak the dewy night has touch'd<br />
“The boundaries plac'd upon th' Hesperian shore.<br />
“I'm call'd,&mdash;for, darkness fled, Aurora shines.<br />
<a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;48]</span>
“Seize then, the reins, or if thy mind relents,<br />
“My counsel rather than my chariot take.<br />
“Now whilst thou can'st; whilst on a solid base<br />
“Thou standest, ere thou yet unskilful mount'st<br />
“The chariot ev'lly wish'd: give me to dart<br />
“Those rays on earth which thou may'st safely view:”<br />
Agile the youth bounds from his sire, and stands<br />
Proud in the chariot; joyously he holds<br />
Th' entrusted reigns, and from the seat glad thanks<br />
Th' unwilling parent gives. Meantime neigh'd loud<br />
In curling flames, the winged steeds of Sol,<br />
Pyroeis, Æthon, Phlegon, Eous swift;<br />
And with impatient hoofs the barrier beat;<br />
Which Tethys, ignorant of her grandson's fate,<br />
Drove back, and open laid the range of heaven.<br />
Swiftly they hasten,&mdash;swiftly fly their heels,<br />
Through the thin air, and through opposing clouds.<br />
Pois'd by their wings the eastern gales they pass,<br />
Which started with them: but their burthen light,<br />
Small felt the pressure on the chariot seat:<br />
Not what the steeds of Sol had felt before.<br />
As ships unpois'd reel tottering through the waves,<br />
Light and unsteady, rambling o'er the main;<br />
So bounds the car, void of its 'custom'd weight,<br />
High-toss'd as though unfill'd. This quick perceiv'd,<br />
Fierce rush the four-yok'd steeds, and quit the path<br />
Beaten before, and tread a road unknown.<br />
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;49]</span>
Trembling the youth nor knows to pull the reins<br />
Which side, nor knowing would the steeds obey.<br />
Then first the frozen Triönes from Sol<br />
Felt warm, and try'd, but try'd in vain, to dip<br />
Beneath the sea. The frozen polar snake,<br />
Sluggish with cold, and indolently mild,<br />
Warm'd, and dire fierceness gather'd from the flames.<br />
Thou too, Boötes, fled'st away disturb'd,<br />
Though slow thy flight, retarded by thy teams.<br />
And now the luckless Phaëton his eyes<br />
Cast on the earth remote,&mdash;far distant spread<br />
Beneath the lofty sky; pale grew his face<br />
With sudden terror; trembled his weak knees;<br />
O'ercome with light his eyes in darkness sunk:<br />
Glad were he now, his father's steeds untouch'd:<br />
Griev'd that his race he knows; griev'd his request<br />
Was undeny'd: glad were he now if call'd<br />
The son of Merops. Ev'n as Boreas sweeps<br />
Furious the vessel, when the pilot leaves<br />
The helm to heaven, and puts his trust in prayers<br />
So was he hurry'd. What remains to do?<br />
Vast space of heaven behind him lies;&mdash;much more<br />
He forward views. Each distance in his mind<br />
Compar'd he measures. Now he forward bends<br />
To view the west, forbidden him to reach;<br />
Now to the east he backward turns his eyes.<br />
With terror stunn'd his trembling hands refuse<br />
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;50]</span>
To hold the reins with vigor; yet he holds.<br />
The coursers' names, affrighted he forgets:<br />
Trembling he views the various monsters spread<br />
Through every part above; and figures huge<br />
Of beasts ferocious. Heaven a spot contains,<br />
Where Scorpio bends in two wide bows his arms,<br />
His tail, and doubly-stretching claws;&mdash;the space<br />
Encompassing of two celestial signs.<br />
Soon as the youth the monstrous beast beheld,<br />
Black poison sweating, and with crooked sting<br />
Threatening fierce wounds, he nerveless dropp'd the reins:<br />
Pale dread o'ercame him. Quick the steeds perceiv'd<br />
The loose thongs playing on their backs, and rush'd<br />
Wide from the path, uncheck'd;&mdash;through regions strange,<br />
Now here, now there, impetuous;&mdash;unrestrain'd,<br />
Amidst the loftiest stars they dash, and drag<br />
The car through pathless places: upward now<br />
They labor;&mdash;headlong now they down descend,<br />
Nearing the earth. With wonder Luna sees<br />
Her brother's coursers run beneath her own;<br />
And sees the burnt clouds smoking. Lofty points<br />
Of earth, feel first the flames, and fissures wide,<br />
Departing moisture prove. The forage green,<br />
Whitens; trees crackle with their burning leaves;<br />
And ripe corn adds its fuel to the blaze.<br />
Why mourn we trifles? Mighty cities fall;<br />
Their walls protect them not; their dwellers sink<br />
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;51]</span>
To ashes with them. Woods on mountains flame;&mdash;<br />
Athos, Cilician Taurus, Tmolus, burn;<br />
Oeté, and Ide, her pleasant fountains dry;<br />
With virgin Helicon, and Hæmus high,<br />
&OElig;agrius since. Now with redoubled flames<br />
Fierce Etna blazes;&mdash;Eryx, Othrys too;<br />
Cynthus, and fam'd Parnassus' double top,<br />
And Rhodopé, at length of snow depriv'd:<br />
Dindyma, Mimas, and the sacred hill<br />
Cythæron nam'd, and lofty Mycalé:<br />
Nor aid their snows the Scythians: Ossa burns,<br />
Pindus, and Caucasus, and, loftier still,<br />
The huge Olympus; with the towering Alps;<br />
And cloud-capt Apennines. Now the youth,<br />
Beholds earth flaming fierce from every part;&mdash;<br />
The heat o'erpowers him; fiery air he breathes<br />
As from a furnace; and the car he rides<br />
Glows with the flame beneath him: sore annoy'd<br />
On every side by cinders, and by smoke<br />
Hot curling round him. Whither now he drives,<br />
Or where he is, he knows not; in a cloud<br />
Of pitchy night involv'd; swept as the steeds<br />
Swift-flying will. The Æthiopians then,<br />
'Tis said, their sable tincture first receiv'd;<br />
Their purple blood the glowing heat call'd forth<br />
To tinge their skins. Then dry'd the scorching fire<br />
From arid Lybia all her fertile streams.<br />
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;52]</span>
Now with dishevell'd locks the nymphs bewail'd<br />
Their fountains and their lakes. B&oelig;otia mourns<br />
The loss of Dircé: Argos Amymoné:<br />
Corinth laments Pirené. Nor yet safe<br />
Were rivers bounded by far distant shores,<br />
Tanais' midmost waves fume to the sky;<br />
And ancient Peneus smokes: Ismenos swift;<br />
Caïcus, Teuthrantean; and the flood<br />
Of Phocis, Erymanthus: Xanthus too,<br />
Doom'd to be fir'd again: Lycormas brown;<br />
Mæander's sportive oft recircling waves;<br />
Mygdonian Melas; and the Spartan flood,<br />
Eurotas; with Euphrates burn: and burn,<br />
Orontes; and the rapid Thermodoon;<br />
Ganges; and Phasis; and the Ister swift.<br />
Alpheus boils; the banks of Spercheus burn;<br />
And Tagus' golden sands the flames dissolve.<br />
Stream-loving swans, whose song melodious rung<br />
Throughout Mæonian regions, feel the heat,<br />
Caïster's streams amid. In terror Nile<br />
Fled to the farthest earth, and sunk his head,<br />
Yet undiscover'd!&mdash;void the seven-fold stream,<br />
His mouth seven dry and dusty vales disclos'd.<br />
Now Hebrus dries, and Strymon, Thracian floods:<br />
And streams Hesperian, Rhine; and Rhone; and Po;<br />
And Tiber, destin'd all the world to rule.<br />
Asunder split the globe, and through the chinks<br />
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;53]</span>
Darted the light to hell: the novel blaze,<br />
Pluto and Proserpine with terror view'd.<br />
The ocean shrinks;&mdash;a dry and scorching plain<br />
Where late was sea appears. Hills lift their heads<br />
Late by the deep waves hid, and countless seem<br />
The scatter'd Cyclades. Deep crouch the fish;&mdash;<br />
The crooked dolphins dare not leap aloft,<br />
As, custom'd in the air; with breasts upturn'd<br />
The gasping sea-calves float upon the waves:<br />
Nereus, with Doris and her daughter-nymphs<br />
Deep plung'd to seek their low, but tepid caves.<br />
Thrice Neptune ventur'd to upraise his arms<br />
Grim frowning,&mdash;thrice the flames too fierce he found,<br />
And shrunk beneath the waters. Earth at length,<br />
(By streams and founts encircled,&mdash;for her womb<br />
Trembling they sought for refuge) rais'd on high<br />
Her face omniferous, dry and parch'd with heat;<br />
Her burning forehead shaded with her hand;<br />
Shook all with tremor huge; then shrank for shade<br />
Beneath, and gasping, thus to heaven she plain'd:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Almighty lord! if such thy sovereign will,<br />
“And I deserve it, why thy lightenings hold<br />
“Thus idle? If by fire to perish doom'd,&mdash;<br />
“Be it by thine,&mdash;an honorable fate!<br />

The steeds confounded; free their fiery necks<br />

Hurl'd headlong falls the youth, his golden locks,<br />
Flame as he tumbles, swept through empty air,<br />
A lengthen'd track he forms: so seems a star<br />
In night serene, but only seems, to shoot.<br />

Receiv'd his burning corps, and quench'd the flames.<br />

Sufficient light: thus may misfortune aid.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Clymené with all that sorrow could<br />
To ease her woes give utterance, loud had wail'd<br />
In wild lament; all spark of reason fled,<br />
Her bosom tearing, through the world she roam'd.<br />
And now his limbs inanimate she sought;<br />
Then for his whiten'd bones: his bones she found,<br />
On banks far distant from his home inhum'd.<br />
Prone on his tomb her form she flung, and pour'd<br />
Her tears in floods upon the graven lines:<br />
And with her bosom bar'd, the cold stone warm'd.<br />
His sisters' love their fruitless offerings bring,<br />
Their griefs and briny droppings; cruel tear<br />
Their beauteous bosoms; while they loudly call<br />
Phaëton, deaf to all their mournful cries.<br />
Stretch'd on his tomb, by night, by day they call'd.<br />
Till Luna's circle four times fill'd was seen;<br />
Their blows still given as 'custom'd, (use had made<br />
Their forms of grief as nature). Sudden plain'd<br />
Fair Phaëthusa, eldest of the three,<br />
Of stiffen'd feet; as on the tomb she strove<br />
To cast her body prone. Lampetie bright,<br />
Rushing in hope to aid, a shooting root<br />
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;57]</span>
Abruptly held. With lifted hands the third<br />
Her locks to tear attempted; but green leaves<br />
Tore off instead. Now this laments her legs,<br />
Bound with thin bark; that mourns to see her arms<br />
Shoot in long branches. While they wonder thus,<br />
Th' increasing bark their bodies upward veils,<br />
Their breasts, their arms, and hands, with gradual growth:<br />
Their mouths alone remain; which loudly call<br />
Their mother. What a mother could, she did:<br />
What could she do? save, here and there to fly,<br />
Where blind affection dragg'd her; and while yet,<br />
'Twas given to join, join with them mouth to mouth.<br />
Nor this contents; she strives to tear the rind,<br />
Their limbs enwrapping; and the tender boughs<br />
Pluck from their hands: but from the rended spot<br />
The sanguine drops flow swift. Each suffering nymph<br />
Cries,&mdash;“Spare me, mother!&mdash;spare your wounded child;<br />
“I suffer in the tree.&mdash;farewell!&mdash;farewell!”&mdash;<br />
For as they spoke the rind their mouths inclos'd.<br />
From these new branches tears were dropp'd, and shap'd<br />
By solar heat, bright amber straight compos'd.<br />
Dropt in the lucid stream, the prize was borne<br />
To Latium, and its gayest nymphs adorn'd.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wonderous change Sthenelian Cycnus saw;<br />
To thee, O Phaëton, by kindred join'd,<br />

<a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;58]</span>
(For o'er Liguria's large and populous towns<br />
He reign'd) had then relinquish'd. With his plaints,<br />
The Po's wide stream was fill'd; and fill'd the banks<br />
With his lamentings; ev'n the woods, whose shade<br />
The sister poplars thicken'd. Soon he feels<br />
His utterance shrill and weak: his streaming locks<br />
Soft snowy plumes displace: high from his chest,<br />
His lengthen'd neck extends: a filmy web<br />
Unites his ruddy toes: his sides are cloth'd<br />
With quills and feathers: where his mouth was seen<br />
Expanded, now a blunted beak obtains;<br />
And Cycnus stands a bird;&mdash;but bird unknown<br />
In days of yore. Mistrustful still of Jove,<br />
His heaven he shuns; as mindful of the flames<br />
From thence unjustly hurl'd. Wide lakes and ponds<br />
He seeks to habit now;&mdash;indignant shuns<br />
What favors fire, and joys in purling streams.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime was Ph&oelig;bus dull, his blaze obscur'd,<br />
As when eclips'd his orb: his rays he hates;<br />
Himself; and even the day. To grief his soul<br />
He gives, and anger to his grief he joins;<br />
Depriving earth of all its wonted light.<br />
“Troubled my lot has been,” he cry'd, “since first<br />
“Was publish'd my existence:&mdash;urg'd my toil<br />
“Endless,&mdash;still unremitted, still unprais'd.<br />
“Now let who will my furious chariot drive<br />

Sol, grieving thus, the deities surround,<br />
And suppliant beg that earth may mourn no more,<br />
By darkness 'whelm'd. Ev'n Jove concession gave,&mdash;<br />
And why his fiery bolts were launch'd explain'd;<br />
But threats and prayers majestically mix'd.<br />
The steeds with terror trembling, Ph&oelig;bus seiz'd,<br />
Wild from their late affright, and rein'd their jaws;<br />
Furious he wields his goad and lash, and fierce<br />
He storms, and their impetuous fury blames<br />
At every blow, as murderers of his son.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;High heaven's huge walls the mighty sire explores,<br />
With eye close searching, lest a weakening flaw,<br />
Might hurl some part to ruin. All he found<br />
Firm in its pristine strength;&mdash;then glanc'd his eye<br />
Around the earth, and toils of man below.<br />
'Bove all terrestrial lands, Arcadia felt&mdash;<br />
His own Arcadia&mdash;his preserving care.<br />

Seed-corn; and foliage to her spreading boughs;<br />
And her scorch'd forests bids again look green.<br />
Through here as oft he journey'd, and return'd,<br />
A virgin of Nonacriné he spy'd,<br />
And instant inward fire the god consum'd.<br />
No nymph was she whose skill the wool prepar'd;<br />
Nor comb'd with art her tresses seem'd; full plain,<br />
Her vest a button held; a fillet white<br />
Careless her hair confin'd. Now pois'd her hand<br />
A javelin light, and now a bow she bore:<br />
In Dian's train she ran, nor nymph more dear<br />
To her the mountain Mænalus e'er trode.<br />
But brief the reign of favor! Sol had now<br />
Beyond mid-heaven attain'd; Calistho sought<br />
A grove where felling axe had never rung:<br />
Here was her quiver from her shoulder thrown;<br />
Her slender bow unstrung; and on the ground<br />
With soft grass clad she rested: 'neath her neck<br />
Was plac'd the painted quiver. Jove, the maid<br />
Weary'd beheld, and from her wonted troop<br />
Far distant. “Surely now, my wife,” he cries,<br />
“This theft can ne'er discover. Should she know,<br />
“What is her rage with such a prize compar'd?”<br />
Then Dian's face and form the god conceal'd;<br />
Loud calling,&mdash;“Where, O virgin, hast thou stray'd?<br />
“What hills, my comrade, hast thou crost in chase?”<br />
Light springing from the turf, the nymph reply'd,&mdash;<br />
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;61]</span>
“Hail goddess, greater, if with me the palm,<br />
“Than Jove himself, though Jove himself should hear.”<br />
The feign'd Diana smil'd, and joy'd to hear<br />
Him to himself preferr'd; then press'd her lips<br />
With kisses, such as virgins never give<br />
To virgins. Her, prepar'd to tell the woods<br />
Where late she hunted, with a warm embrace<br />
He hinder'd; and his crime the god disclos'd.<br />
Hard strove the nymph,&mdash;and what could female more?<br />
(O Juno, hadst thou seen her, less thy ire!)<br />
Long she resists, but what can nymph attain,<br />
Or any mortal, when to Jove oppos'd?<br />
Victor the god ascends th' ethereal court.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groves and forests, conscious of the deed,<br />
Calistho hates; so swift she flies the spot,<br />
Her quiver, and her darts, and slender bow<br />
Suspended on the tree, through eager haste<br />
Were nigh forgotten. Lo! Diana comes,<br />
By clustering nymphs attended, o'er the hills<br />
Of lofty Mænalus, from slaughter'd beasts,<br />
Proudly triumphant. She Calistho sees,<br />
And calls her;&mdash;as the goddess calls she flies,<br />
Fearing another Jove disguis'd to meet.<br />
But when th' attendant virgin-troop appear'd,<br />
Fraud she no more suspected, but the train<br />
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;62]</span>
Join'd fearless. Hard the countenance to form,<br />
And not betray a perpetrated crime!<br />
Scarce from the ground she dar'd her looks to raise;<br />
Nor with her wonted ardor press'd before,<br />
First of the throng, close to Diana's side.<br />
Silent she moves; her blushes prove a wound<br />
Her modesty had felt. E'en Dian' might,<br />
(But that a virgin,) all the truth have known.<br />
By numerous proofs and strong. Nay, fame reports<br />
Her sister-nymphs had long her shame perceiv'd.<br />
Nine times had Luna now her orb renew'd,<br />
When Dian' from the chase retreating faint<br />
By Ph&oelig;bus' rays, had gain'd a forest cool,<br />
Where flow'd a limpid stream with murmuring noise,<br />
The shining sand upturning. Much the spot<br />
The goddess tempted, and her feet she dipp'd<br />
Light in the waves, as to the nymphs she cry'd:&mdash;<br />
“Hence far each prying eye, we'll dare unrobe<br />
“And lave beneath the stream.” Calistho blush'd;&mdash;<br />
Quick while the other nymphs their bodies bare,<br />
Protracting she undresses. From her limbs,<br />
Suspicious they the garments rend, and view<br />
Her body naked, and her fault is plain.<br />
To her, confus'd, whose trembling hands essay'd<br />
Her shame to hide, Diana spoke;&mdash;“Hence fly,&mdash;<br />
“Far hence, nor more these sacred streams pollute.”<br />
And drove her instant from her spotless train.<br />
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;63]</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time the mighty thunderer's queen had known<br />
Calistho's state; but curb'd her furious ire<br />
Till ripe occasion suited: longer now<br />
Delay were needless; now the nymph produc'd<br />
Arcas; whom Juno more enrag'd beheld.<br />
With savage mind, and furious look she ey'd<br />
The boy, and spoke;&mdash;“Adulteress! this alone<br />
“Was wanting! fruitful, harlot, hast thou prov'd?<br />
“Must by this birth my wrongs in public glare?<br />
“And what dishonor I from Jove receive<br />
“Be palpable to sight. Expect not thou<br />
“Impunity to find. Thy form I'll change,&mdash;<br />
“To thee so pleasing, and so dear to Jove.”<br />
She said; and on the flowing tresses seiz'd<br />
Which o'er her forehead stream'd, and prostrate dragg'd<br />
The nymph to earth. She rais'd her suppliant hands,&mdash;<br />
With black hairs cover'd, rough her arms appear'd;<br />
Bent were her hands, and, with her lengthen'd nails<br />
To claws transform'd, press'd on the ground as feet;<br />
Her mouth so beauteous, late of Jove admir'd,<br />
Yawn'd wide deformity;&mdash;and lest soft prayers<br />
And flowing words, might pity move, no power<br />
To speak she left. Now through her hoarse throat sounds<br />
An angry threatening voice that fear instills;<br />
A bear becoming, though her sense the same:<br />
Her sufferings proving by her constant groans.<br />
Lifting to heaven such hands as lift she could,<br />
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;64]</span>
Jove she ungrateful found, but Jove to call<br />
Ungrateful, strove in vain. Alas! how oft<br />
In woods and solitudes, to sleep afraid,<br />
She roam'd around the house and fertile fields<br />
Of late her own!&mdash;-Alas, how oft thence driven<br />
By yelping hounds o'er craggy steeps she fled!<br />
Thou dread'st the hunters though an huntress thou!<br />
Oft was her form forgotten, and in fear<br />
From beasts she crouch'd conceal'd: the shaggy bear<br />
Shudder'd to see the bears upon the hills;<br />
And at the wolves she trembled, though with wolves<br />
Her sire Lycaön howl'd. Now Arcas comes;<br />
Arcas, her son, unconscious of his race.<br />
Near fifteen suns the youth had seen revolv'd;<br />
And while the game he chases, while he seeks<br />
Thickets best suited for his sports, and round<br />
The Erymanthean woods his toils he sets,<br />
He meets his mother:&mdash;at his sight she stay'd,<br />
The well-known object viewing. Arcas fled<br />
Trembling, unconscious why those eyes were fix'd<br />
On him immoveably. His spear, prepar'd<br />
To pierce his mother's breast, as near she draws<br />
The youth protends. But Jove the deed prevents:<br />
Both bears away, and stays the matricide.<br />
Swept through the void of heaven by rapid whirl<br />
They're borne, and neighbouring constellations made,<br />

Whom fair Chariclo, on a river's brink<br />
Swift-rolling, bore, and thence Ocyrrhoë nam'd.<br />
She not content her father's arts to know,<br />
The hidden secrets of the fates disclos'd.<br />
Now was her soul with fate-foretelling sounds<br />
Fill'd, and within her fiercely rag'd the god:<br />
The infant viewing;&mdash;“Grow,” she said, “apace,<br />
“Health-bearer through the world. To thee shall oft<br />
“Expiring mortals owe returning life!<br />
“To thee 'tis given to render souls again<br />
“Back to their bodies! Once thou'lt dare the deed;&mdash;<br />
“The angry god's forbidding flames, thy power<br />
“Further preventing:&mdash;and a bloodless corps<br />
“Heaven-born, thou ly'st;&mdash;-but what thy body form'd<br />
“A god becomes,&mdash;resuscitated twice.<br />
“Thou too, my dearest and immortal sire!<br />
“To ages never-ending, born to live,<br />
“Shalt wish for death in vain; when writhing sad<br />

“Thy destin'd fate, and let immortal die:<br />
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;72]</span>
“The triple sisters shall thy thread divide.<br />
“More yet untold remains;”&mdash;Deep from her chest<br />
The sighs burst forth, and starting tears stream down,<br />
Laving her cheeks, while thus the maid pursues:<br />
“The fates prevent me, and forbid to tell<br />
“What more I would;&mdash;all power to speak deny.<br />
“Those arts, alas! heaven's anger which have drawn,&mdash;<br />
“What were they? Would I ne'er the future knew!<br />
“Now seems my human shape to leave me. Now<br />
“The verdant grass a pleasing food appears.<br />
“Now am I urg'd along the plain to bound;<br />
“Chang'd to a mare: unto my sire ally'd<br />
“In form,&mdash;but why sole chang'd? my father bears<br />
“A two-form'd body;”&mdash;Wailing thus, her words<br />
Confus'd and indistinct at length are heard.<br />
Next sounds are utter'd partly human, more<br />
A mare's resembling:&mdash;then she neighs aloud;<br />
Treading with alter'd arms the ground: fast join'd<br />
Her fingers now become: a slender hoof<br />
Her toes connecting with continuous horn.<br />
Her head enlarges; and her neck expands;<br />
Her spreading garment floats a beauteous tail:<br />
Her scatter'd tresses o'er her shoulders flung,<br />
Form a thick mane to clothe her spacious neck:<br />
Her voice is alter'd with her alter'd shape:<br />
And change of name the wonderous deed attends.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep Chiron mourn'd, O Ph&oelig;bus, and thy aid<br />
In vain invok'd; for bootless was thy power<br />
Jove's mandate to resist; nor if thou could'st<br />
Then wast thou nigh to help. In Elis far,<br />
And fields Messenian then was thy abode.<br />
Then was the time when shepherd-like a robe<br />
Of skins enwrapp'd thee;&mdash;when thy left hand bore<br />
A sylvan staff;&mdash;thy right a pipe retain'd,<br />
Of seven unequal reeds. While love engag'd<br />
Thy thoughts, and dulcet music sooth'd thy cares,<br />
'Tis said, thy herds without their herdsman stray'd,<br />
Far to the Pylian meadows. These the son<br />
Of Atlantean Maiä espy'd;<br />
And, slily driven away, within the woods<br />
The cattle artful hid. None saw the deed,<br />
Save one old hoary swain, well known around,<br />
And Battus nam'd; whose post it was to guard<br />
The groves, the grassy meads, and high-bred mares<br />
Of wealthy Neleus. Him the robber fear'd;<br />
Drew him aside, and coaxing thus address'd;&mdash;<br />
“Whoe'er thou art, good friend, if here perchance,<br />
“Someone should seek an herd,&mdash;say that thou here<br />
“No herd hast seen;&mdash;thou shall not lack reward:<br />
“Take this bright heifer:”&mdash;and the cow he gave.<br />
The bribe receiv'd, the shepherd thus replies;<br />
“Friend, thou art safe,&mdash;that stone shall sooner speak<br />
“And tell thy deed than I:”&mdash;and shew'd the stone.<br />
<a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;74]</span>
The son of Jove departs, or seems to go;<br />
But soon with alter'd form and voice returns.<br />
“Here, countryman,” he cries, “hast thou an herd<br />
“This way observ'd to pass?&mdash;no secret keep,<br />
“To aid the theft; an heifer with a bull<br />
“Await thy information.” Doubly brib'd,<br />
The hoary rogue betray'd his former trust.<br />
“Beneath those hills,” he said, “the herd you'll find.”<br />
Beneath the hills they were. Loud laugh'd the god<br />
And cry'd,&mdash;“Thou treacherous villain, to myself<br />
“Wouldst thou betray me? wouldst thou to myself<br />
“My deeds betray?” And to a flinty stone<br />
His perjur'd breast he chang'd, which still retains<br />
The name of Touchstone;&mdash;on the harmless rock<br />
His infamous demerits firmly fix'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermes from hence, on waving wings upborne<br />
Darted, and in his flight beneath him saw<br />
The Attic pastures,&mdash;the much-favor'd land<br />
Of Pallas; and Lyceum's cultur'd groves.<br />
It chanc'd that day, as wont, the virgins chaste,<br />
Bore on their heads in canisters festoon'd,<br />
Their offerings pure to Pallas' sacred fane.<br />
Returning thence the winged god espy'd<br />
The troop, and straight his onward flight restrain'd;<br />
Wheeling in circles round. As sails the kite,<br />
Swiftest of birds, when entrails seen from far<br />
<a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;75]</span>
By holy augurs thick beset,&mdash;he fears<br />
A near approach, but circling steers his flight<br />
On beating wings, around his hopes and round.<br />
So 'bove the Athenian towers the light-plum'd god<br />
Swept round in circles on the self-same air.<br />
As Phosphor far outshines the starry host;<br />
As silver Cynthia Phosphor bright outshines;<br />
So much did Hersé all the nymphs excel,<br />
The bright procession's ornament; the pride<br />
Of all th' accompanying nymphs. Her beauteous mien<br />
Stagger'd Jove's son, who hovering in the air<br />
Fierce burns with love. The Balearic sling,<br />
Thus shoots a ball; quick through the air it flies,<br />
Warms in its flight, and feels beneath the clouds<br />
Flames hereto known not. Alter'd now his route<br />
The skies he leaves, and holds a different flight:<br />
Nor veils his figure,&mdash;such reliance gave<br />
His beauteous form: and beauteous though that form,<br />
Yet careful did the god his looks adorn;<br />
He smoothes his tresses, and his robe adjusts<br />
To hang in graceful folds, and fair display<br />
The golden fringe; his round and slender wand,<br />
Of sleep-procuring, sleep-repelling power,<br />
His right hand bears; and on his comely feet<br />
His plumed sandals shine. Within the house<br />
Three separate chambers were secluded form'd,<br />
With tortoise and with ivory rich adorn'd.<br />
<a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;76]</span>
Thou, Pandrosos, within the right repos'd;<br />
And on the left hand thou Aglauros, slept;<br />
Fair Hersé in the midst. Aglauros first<br />
The god's approach descry'd, and daring ask'd<br />
Who he?&mdash;and what he sought?&mdash;To whom the god;<br />
“Him you behold, who through the air conveys<br />
“His sire's commands: Almighty Jove that sire.<br />
“Nor will I feign my errand. So may'st thou<br />
“True to thy sister prove, and soon be call'd<br />
“My offspring's aunt. 'Tis Hersé draws me here.<br />
“Help then a lover in his warm pursuit.”<br />
Aglauros bends on Mercury those eyes,<br />
Which yellow-hair'd Minerva's secret saw;<br />
And ponderous sums for her assistance claims;<br />
Driving the god meantime without the gates.<br />
With angry glare the warlike goddess view'd<br />
The mercenary nymph, and angry sighs,<br />
Which shook her bosom heav'd; the Ægis shook,<br />
On that strong bosom fix'd. Now calls to mind<br />
Minerva how with hands prophane, the maid<br />
Her strict behests despising, daring pry'd<br />
To know her secrets; and the seed beheld<br />
Of Vulcan, child without a mother form'd:<br />
Now to her sister and the god unkind;<br />
Rich with the gold her avarice had claim'd.<br />
To Envy's gloomy cell, where clots of gore<br />
The floor defil'd, enrag'd Minerva flew:<br />
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;77]</span>
A darkened vale, deep sunk, the cavern held,<br />
where vivid sun ne'er shone, nor freshening breeze<br />
Health wafted: torpid melancholy rul'd,<br />
And sluggish cold; and cheering light unknown,<br />
Damp darkness ever gloom'd. The goddess here<br />
In conflict dreaded came, but at the doors<br />
Her footsteps staid, for entrance Fate forbade.<br />
The gates she strikes&mdash;struck by her spear, the gates<br />
Wide open fly, and dark within disclose,<br />
On vipers gorging, (her accustom'd feast,)<br />
The envious fiend: back from the hideous sight<br />
Recoils the goddess, and averts her eyes.<br />
Slow rising from the ground, her half chew'd food<br />
She quits, advancing indolently forth:<br />
The maid, in warlike brightness clad, she saw,<br />
In form divine, and heavy sighs burst forth<br />
Deep from her bosom's black recess: pale gloom.<br />
Dwells on her forehead; lean her fleshless form;<br />
Askaunce her eyes; encrusted black her teeth;<br />
Green'd deep with gall her breasts; her hideous tongue<br />
With poisons lurid; laughter knows her not,<br />
Save woes and pangs unmerited she sees;<br />
Sleep flies her couch, by cares unceasing wrung;<br />
At men's success she sickens, pining sad;<br />
But stung herself, while others feel her sting<br />
Her torture closely grasps her.&mdash;Much the maid<br />
The sight abhors; and thus in brief she speaks:&mdash;<br />
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;78]</span>
“Deep in the breast of Cecrops' daughter fix<br />
“Thy venom'd sting&mdash;Aglauros is the nymph.&mdash;<br />
“More needs not.”&mdash;Speaking so Minerva fled,<br />
Upbounding, earth she with her spear repell'd.<br />
Glancing asquint the fury saw her rise,<br />
And inly groan'd,&mdash;that she success should gain.<br />
Her staff with prickly thorns enwreath'd she takes,<br />
And forth she sallies, wrapp'd in gloomy clouds.<br />
Where'er she flies she blasts the flowery fields;<br />
Consumes the herbage; and the harvest blights.<br />
Her breath pestiferous felt the cities round,<br />
Houses and 'habitants where'er she flew.<br />
At length the towers of Athens she beheld<br />
With arts and riches flourishing, and blest<br />
With holy peace. Scarce could she tears withhold,<br />
No tearful eye throughout the place to see.<br />
Straight to the room of Cecrops' daughter now<br />
Her route she urges, and her task performs:<br />
Her rusty hand upon the maiden's breast<br />
She plants, and with sharp thorns that bosom fills;<br />
Breathes noxious poison through her frame; imbues<br />
With venom black her heart, and all her limbs.<br />
Lest from her eyes escap'd, the maddening scene<br />
Should cease to vex her, full in view she plac'd<br />
Her sister, and her sister's nuptial rites;<br />
And Hermes beauteous in the bridal pomp:<br />
In beauty all, and splendor all increas'd.<br />
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;79]</span>
Mad with the imag'd sight, the maid is gnawn<br />
With secret pangs;&mdash;deep groans the lengthen'd night,<br />
And deep the morning hears; she wastes away<br />
Silently wretched, lingeringly slow.<br />
As Sol's faint rays the summer ice dissolves:<br />
So burns she to behold the envy'd lot<br />
Of Hersé; not with furious flames,&mdash;as weeds<br />
Blaze not when damp, but with slow heat consume.<br />
Oft would she wish to die: and oft the deed<br />
To hinder, thinks to tell her rigid sire<br />
Her sister's fault. At length her seat she takes<br />
Across the threshold, and th' approaching god<br />
Repuls'd; and to his blandishments, and words<br />
Beseeching fair, and soft-alluring prayers,<br />
She cry'd,&mdash;“Desist,&mdash;from hence I ne'er will move<br />
“Till thou art driven away.” Swift Hermes said.&mdash;<br />
“Keep firmly that resolve.” And with his wand<br />
The sculptur'd portals touching, wide they flew.<br />
But when her limbs to raise, the virgin strove,<br />
A weighty numbness o'er the members crept<br />
Which bend in sitting, and their movement staid.<br />
Strenuous she strives to raise her form erect,<br />
But stiffen'd feels her knees; chill coldness spreads<br />
Through all her toes; and, fled the purple stream,<br />
Her veins turn pallid: cruel cancer thus,<br />
Disease incurable, spreads far and wide,<br />
Sound members adding to the parts diseas'd.<br />
<a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;80]</span>
So gradual, o'er her breast the chilling frost<br />
Crept deadly, and the gates of life shut close.<br />
Complaint she try'd not; had she try'd, her voice<br />
Had found no passage, for the stone had seiz'd<br />
Her throat,&mdash;her mouth; to marble all was chang'd.<br />
She sat a pallid statue;&mdash;all the stone<br />
Her envy tainted with a livid hue.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vengeance, when Jove's son complete had seen,<br />
Due to her avarice, and her envious soul;<br />
He left Minerva's land, and up the sky<br />
On wafting pinions mounted. There his sire,<br />
Him from th' assembly drew; nor yet disclos'd,<br />
The object of his love:&mdash;“Son, quickly haste,&mdash;<br />
“Thou faithful messenger of my commands,<br />
“Urge rapid thy descending flight, and seek<br />
“The realm whose northern bounds thy mother star<br />
“O'erlooks,&mdash;the land by natives Sidon call'd.<br />
“There wilt thou pasturing find the royal herd,<br />
“'Neath hills not distant from the sea: turn down<br />
“This herd to meadows bordering on the beach.”<br />
He said;&mdash;the cattle tow'rd the sea shore move,<br />
Where sported with her Tyrian maids as wont,<br />
The monarch's daughter. Ill majestic state<br />
And love agree; nor long combin'd remain.<br />
The sire and ruler of the gods resigns<br />
His weighty sceptre: he whose right hand bears<br />
<a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;81]</span>
The three-fork'd fires; whose nod creation shakes,<br />
Assumes a bull's appearance:&mdash;with the herd<br />
Mingles; and strolling lets the tender shrubs<br />
Brush his fair sides. Of snowy white his skin;<br />
Such snow as rugged feet has never soil'd,<br />
Nor southern showers dissolv'd: his brawny neck,<br />
Strong from his shoulders stands: beneath extends<br />
The dewlap pendulous: small are his horns;<br />
But smooth as polish'd by the workman's hand;&mdash;<br />
Pellucid as the brightest gems they shine:<br />
No threatenings wear his brow; no fire his eyes<br />
Flame fierce; but all his countenance peace proclaims.<br />
Him much Agenor's royal maid admir'd;&mdash;<br />
His form so beauteous, and his look so mild.<br />
Yet peaceful as he seem'd, she fear'd at first<br />
A close approach;&mdash;but nearer soon she drew,<br />
And to his shining mouth the flowery food<br />
Presented. Joy'd th' impatient lover stands,<br />
Her fingers kissing; and with sore restraint<br />
Defers his look'd for pleasures. Sportive now<br />
He wantons, frisking in the grass; now rolls<br />
His snowy sides upon the yellow sand.<br />
Her apprehensions chas'd, by slow degrees,<br />
The virgin's fingers playful stroke his breast;<br />
Then bind with wreaths his horns: more daring now<br />
Upon his back the royal maid ascends;&mdash;<br />
Witless a god she presses. From the fields,<br />
<a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;82]</span>
His steps deceitful gradual turn'd, he bends,<br />
And seeks the shore; then playful in the waves<br />
Just dips his feet;&mdash;thence plunging deep, he swims<br />
Through midmost ocean with his ravish'd prize.<br />
Trembling the nymph beholds the lessening shore;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Firm grasps one hand his horn; upon his back,<br />
Secure the other resting: to the wind,<br />
Her fluttering garments floating as she sails.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the god, his bestial form resign'd,<br />
Shone in his form celestial as he gain'd<br />
The Cretan shore. Meantime, the theft unknown,<br />
Mourn'd her sad sire, and Cadmus sent to seek<br />
The ravish'd maid; stern threatening as he went,<br />
Perpetual exile if his searching fail'd:&mdash;<br />
Parental love and cruelty combin'd!<br />
All earth explor'd in vain, (for who shall find<br />
The amorous thefts of Jove?) the exile shuns<br />
His father's anger, and paternal soil.<br />
A suppliant bends before Apollo's shrine,<br />
To ask his aid;&mdash;what region he should chuse<br />
<a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;86]</span>
To fix his habitation. Ph&oelig;bus thus;&mdash;<br />
“A cow, whose neck the yoke has never prest,<br />
“Strange to the crooked plough, shall meet thy steps,<br />
“Lone in the desert fields: the way she leads<br />
“Chuse thou,&mdash;rand where upon the grass she rests,<br />
“Erect thy walls;&mdash;B&oelig;otia call the place.”<br />
Scarce had the cave Castalian Cadmus left,<br />
When he an heifer, gently pacing, spy'd<br />
Untended; one whose neck no mark betray'd<br />
Of galling service. Closely treads the youth,<br />
Slow moving in her footsteps, and adores<br />
In silence Ph&oelig;bus, leader of his way.<br />
Now had he pass'd the Cephisidian stream,<br />
And meads of Panopé, when stay'd the beast;<br />
Her broad front lifted to the sky; reverse<br />
Her lofty horns reclining, shook the air<br />
With lowings loud; back then her face she bent,<br />
And saw the comrades following close behind:<br />
Down low she couch'd, and press'd the yielding grass,<br />
Glad thanks to Ph&oelig;bus, Cadmus gave, and kiss'd<br />
The foreign soil;&mdash;the unknown hills, and land<br />
Saluted. Then a sacrifice to Jove<br />
Preparing, sent his followers to explore<br />
Streams flowing from the living fountain clear.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ancient forest hallow'd from the axe,<br />
Not far there stood; in whose dark bosom gloom'd<br />
<a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;87]</span>
A cavern:&mdash;twigs and branches thick inwove<br />
With rocky crags, a low arch'd entrance form'd;<br />
Where pure and copious, gush'd transparent waves.<br />
Deep hid within a monstrous serpent lay,<br />
Sacred to Mars. Bright shone his crested head;<br />
His eyeballs glow'd with fire; his body swell'd<br />
Bloated with poison; o'er a threefold row<br />
Of murderous teeth, three quivering tongues he shook.<br />
This grove the Tyrians with ill-fated feet<br />
Now enter'd; and now in the waters threw,<br />
With noisy dash, their urns. Uprears his head,<br />
The azure serpent from the cavern deep;<br />
And breathes forth hisses dire: their urns they drop;<br />
The blood forsakes their bodies; sudden fear<br />
Chills their astonish'd limbs. He writhing quick,<br />
Forms scaly circles; spiral twisting round,<br />
Bends in an arch immense to leap, and rears<br />
In the thin air erect, 'bove half his height;<br />
All the wide grove o'erlooking. Such his size,<br />
Could all be seen, than that vast snake no less,<br />
Whose huge bulk lies the Arctic bears between.<br />
The Tyrians quick he seizes; some their arms<br />
Vain grasping,&mdash;flying some,&mdash;and some through fear<br />
To fight or fly unable:&mdash;these his jaws<br />
Crash murderous; those his writhing tail surrounds;<br />
Others his breath, with poison loaded, kills.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now loftiest Ph&oelig;bus shorten'd shadows gave,<br />
When Cadmus, wondering much why still his friends<br />
Tarried so long, their parting footsteps trac'd.<br />
His robe an hide torn from a lion's back;<br />
A dart and spear of shining steel his arms;<br />
With courage, arms surpassing. Now the grove<br />
He enters, and their breathless limbs beholds;&mdash;<br />
Their victor foe's huge bulk upon them stretch'd;<br />
Licking with gory tongue their mournful wounds.<br />
“My faithful friends,” he cry'd, “I will avenge<br />
“Your fate,&mdash;or perish with you.” Straight a rock<br />
His right hand rais'd, and with impetuous force,<br />
Hurl'd it right on. A city's lofty walls<br />
With all its towers, to feel the blow had shook!<br />
Yet lay the beast unwounded; safely sheath'd<br />
With scaly armour, and his harden'd hide:&mdash;<br />
His skin alone the furious blow repell'd.<br />
Not so that hardness mocks the javelin,&mdash;fixt<br />
Firm in the bending of the pliant spine<br />
His weapon stood,&mdash;and all the iron head<br />
Deep in his entrails sunk. Mad with the pain,<br />
Reverse he writhes his head;&mdash;beholds the wound;<br />
Champs the fixt dart;&mdash;by many forceful tugs<br />
Loosen'd at length, he tears the shaft away;<br />
But deep the steel within his bones remains.<br />
Now to his wonted fury fiercer flames<br />
This torture adding, big with poison swells<br />
<a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;89]</span>
His throat; and flowing, round his venom'd jaws,<br />
White foam appears; deep harrow'd with his scales<br />
Loud sounds the earth; and vapours black, breath'd out<br />
His mouth infernal, taint with death the air.<br />
Now roll'd in spires, he forms an orb immense:<br />
Now stretch'd at length he seems a monstrous beam:<br />
Now rushing forward with impetuous force,<br />
As sweeps a torrent swell'd by rain, his breast<br />
Bears down th' opposing forest. Cadmus back<br />
A step recedes, and on his lion's hide<br />
The shock sustains;&mdash;then with protended spear<br />
Checks his approaching jaws. Furious he strives<br />
To wound the harden'd steel;&mdash;on the sharp point<br />
He grinds his teeth: now from his poisonous mouth,<br />
Began the blood to flow, and sprinkling ting'd<br />
The virid grass; but trivial still the hurt;<br />
For shrinking from the blow, and twisting back<br />
His wounded neck, the stroke he still prevents<br />
Deeper to pierce, by yielding to its force.<br />
But pushing arduous on, Agenor's son,<br />
Fix'd in his throat the steel;&mdash;and the sharp point<br />
Forc'd through his neck: an oak oppos'd behind;&mdash;<br />
The tree and neck the spear at once transfix'd.<br />
Dragg'd by the monster's weight low bends the tree,<br />
And groans and cracks, as lashing blows, his tail<br />
Immense, deals round. Now whilst the victor stands<br />
And wondering views the conquer'd serpent's size,<br />
<a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;90]</span>
Sudden a voice is heard, (from whence unknown,&mdash;<br />
But plain the words he hears) “Why view'st thou thus,<br />
“Agenor's son, the foe by thee destroy'd?<br />
“Thou one day like this serpent shalt be seen.”<br />
Aghast he stood,&mdash;the warm blood fled his cheeks;<br />
His courage chang'd to terror; freezing fear<br />
Rais'd his stiff locks erect. Lo! Pallas comes,<br />
Pallas, the known protectress of the brave.<br />
Smooth sliding from the higher clouds she comes;<br />
Bids him remove the soil, and place beneath,<br />
The serpent's fangs, a future offspring's pledge.<br />
The prince obeys; and as with crooked share,<br />
The ground he opens, in the furrows throws<br />
The teeth directed. Thence, (beyond belief!)<br />
The clods of earth at once began to move;<br />
Then in the furrows glitter'd, first, the points<br />
Of spears: anon fair painted crests arose,<br />
Above bright helmets nodding: shoulders next;<br />
And breasts; and arms, with javelins loaded came:<br />
Thickening the harvest grew of shielded men.<br />
Thus shews the glad theatric curtain; rais'd<br />
The painted figures' faces first appear,<br />
Gradual display'd; and more by slow degrees;<br />
At length the whole stand forth, their feet all fix'd<br />
Firm on the lower margin. Wondering, he<br />
His new-made foe beheld; and grasp'd his arms.<br />
But one whom earth had just produc'd, exclaim'd;&mdash;<br />
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;91]</span>
“Arm not, nor meddle in our civil broils.”<br />
He said,&mdash;an earth-born brother, hand to hand<br />
With sword keen-edg'd attacking; but from far,<br />
A javelin hurl'd, dispatch'd him. Short the boast<br />
Of him who sent it;&mdash;his death wound infix'd,&mdash;<br />
He breathes the air out he so late receiv'd.<br />
So rage the rest, and in the furious war<br />
The new-made brethren fall by mutual wounds:<br />
And on their blood-stain'd mother, dash, the youths<br />
To short existence born, their damp cold breasts.<br />

Exalted view'd each equi-distant goal;<br />
When the young Theban hunter thus address'd,<br />
His fellow sportsmen with a friendly call;<br />
As wide they rov'd the savage lairs among.<br />
“Our weapons, comrades, and our nets are moist<br />

</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near stood a vale, where pointed cypress form'd<br />
With gloomy pines a grateful shade, and nam'd<br />
Gargaphié;&mdash;sacred to the girded maid:<br />
Its deep recess a shrubby cavern held,<br />
<a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;93]</span>
By nature modell'd,&mdash;but by nature, art<br />
Seem'd equall'd, or excell'd. A native arch<br />
Of pumice light, and tophus dry, was form'd;<br />
And from the right a stream transparent flow'd,<br />
Of trivial size, which spread a pool below;<br />
With grassy margin circled. Dian' here,<br />
The woodland goddess, weary'd with the chace,<br />
Had oft rejoic'd to bathe her virgin limbs.<br />
As wont she comes;&mdash;her quiver, and her dart,<br />
And unstrung bow, her armour-bearing nymph<br />
In charge receives. Disrob'd, another's arms<br />
Sustain her vest. Two from her feet unloose<br />
Her sandals. Crocalé, Ismenian nymph,<br />
Than others more expert, her tresses binds,<br />
Loose o'er her shoulders floating, in a knot;<br />
Her own wild flowing still. Five more the streams<br />
In huge urns lifting; Hyalé, and Niphé,<br />
Phialé, Rhanis, Psecas, lave her limbs.<br />
Here while the goddess in the limpid wave<br />
Washes as 'custom'd,&mdash;lo! Actæon comes;&mdash;<br />
His sportive toil till morning dawn deferr'd:<br />
And roving through the vale with random steps,<br />
By hapless fate conducted, he arrives<br />
Close to the sacred grove. Within the grot<br />
Stream-pouring, when he stept, the naked nymphs,&mdash;<br />
Then first by man beheld,&mdash;their bosoms beat;<br />
Fill'd the deep grove with outcries loud; and round<br />
<a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;94]</span>
Diana crowded, screening as they could<br />
Her limbs with theirs. Yet high above them tower'd<br />
The goddess, and her neck their heads o'erlook'd.<br />
As blush the clouds by Ph&oelig;bus' adverse rays<br />
Deep ting'd;&mdash;or as Aurora in the morn;<br />
So blush'd the virgin-goddess, seen unrob'd.<br />
Sideway she stood, though closely hemm'd around<br />
By clustering nymphs, and backward bent her face:<br />
Then anxious praying she could reach her darts,<br />
In vain,&mdash;she seiz'd the waters which she could,<br />
And dash'd them o'er his features:&mdash;as his locks,<br />
The vengeful drops besprinkled, thus in rage,<br />
She cry'd,&mdash;“Now tell thou hast Diana seen<br />
“Disrob'd;&mdash;go tell it, if thou canst,”&mdash;no more,<br />
With threatenings storm'd, but on his sprinkled head,<br />
The antlers of the long-liv'd stag are plac'd.<br />
His neck is lengthen'd; with a sharpen'd point,<br />
His upright ears are form'd; to feet his hands,&mdash;<br />
To long and slender legs his arms are chang'd;<br />
And round his body clings a dappled coat.<br />
Fear in his bosom she instils: the youth,<br />
The bold Actæon flies, and wondering feels<br />
His bounding feet so rapid in the race.<br />
But soon the waters shew'd his branching horns;<br />
And,&mdash;“ah unhappy me!” he strove to cry:<br />
His voice he found not; sighs and sobs were all;<br />
And tears fast streaming down his alter'd face.<br />
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;95]</span>
Still human sense remains. Where shall he turn?<br />
His royal palace seek,&mdash;or in the woods<br />
Secluded hide?&mdash;To tarry fear forbids,<br />
And shame prevents returning. While he doubts<br />
His hounds espy him. Quick-nos'd Tracer first,<br />
And Blackfoot give the signal by their yell:<br />
Tracer of Crete, and Blackfoot Spartan bred.<br />
Swifter than air the noisy pack rush on;<br />
Arcadian Quicksight; Glutton; Ranger, stout;<br />
Strong Killbuck; Whirlwind, furious; Hunter, fierce;<br />
Flyer, swift-footed; and quick-scented Snap:<br />
Ringwood, late wounded by a furious bear;<br />
And Forester, by savage wolf begot:<br />
Flock-tending Shepherdess; with Ravener fierce,<br />
And her two whelps; and Sicyonian Catch:<br />
The thin flank'd greyhound, Racer; Yelper; Patch;<br />
Tiger; Robust; Milkwhite, with snowy coat;<br />
And coalblack Soot. First in the race, fleet Storm;<br />
Courageous Spartan Swift; and rapid Wolf;<br />
Join'd with his Cyprian brother, Snatch, well mark'd<br />
With sable forehead on a coat of white:<br />
Blackcoat: and thickhair'd Shag: Worrier; and Wild,&mdash;<br />
Twins from a dam Laconian sprung, their sire<br />
Dictæan: Babbler with his noisy throat:&mdash;<br />
But all to name were endless. Urg'd by hope<br />
Of prey they crowd; down precipices rush;<br />
O'er rocks, and crags; through rugged paths, and ways<br />
<a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;96]</span>
Unpass'd before. His hounds he flies, where oft<br />
His hounds he had pursu'd. Poor wretch! he flies<br />
His own domestics, striving hard to call,<br />
“Actæon am I!&mdash;villains, know your lord.”<br />
Words aid him not: loud rings the air with yells,<br />
Howlings, and barkings:&mdash;Blackhair first, his teeth<br />
Fix'd in his back; staunch Tamer fasten'd next;<br />
And Rover seiz'd his shoulder: tardy these,<br />
The rest far left behind, but o'er the hills<br />
Athwart, the chase they shorten'd. Now the pack,<br />
Join'd them their lord retaining; join'd their teeth<br />
Their victim seizing:&mdash;now his body bleeds,<br />
A wound continuous: deep he utters groans,<br />
Not human, yet unlike a dying deer;<br />
And fills the well-known mountains with his plaint.<br />
Prone on his knees in suppliant form he bends;<br />
And low beseeching waves his silent head,<br />
As he would wave his hands. His witless friends,<br />
The savage pack with joyous outcries urge;<br />
Actæon anxious seeking: echoing loud<br />
Eager his name as absent. At the name,<br />
His head he turns. His absence irks them sore,<br />
As lazy loitering, not the noble prey<br />
Obtain'd, beholding. Joyful could he be,<br />
At distance now,&mdash;but hapless is too near:<br />
Glad would he see the furious dogs their fangs,<br />
On other prey than his torn limbs infix.<br />
<a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;97]</span>
On every side they crowd; their dying lord,<br />
A well-seem'd deer, they rend; their ravenous teeth<br />
Deep tear his members. With a thousand wounds,<br />
(Dian's insatiate anger less despis'd)<br />
The hapless hunter yielded forth his breath.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report flies dubious; some the goddess blame<br />
For disproportion'd vengeance; others warm<br />
Applaud the deed as worthy one so pure;<br />
And reasons weighty either party urge:<br />
Jove's consort only silent: she nor blames<br />
The action, nor approves; but inward joys,<br />
Agenor's house should such misfortune feel.<br />
The hatred nourish'd for the Tyrian maid,<br />
Her brother's offspring visits. Now fresh cause<br />
Of wrath succeeds; enrag'd the goddess learns<br />
That Semelé, embrac'd by mighty Jove,<br />
Is pregnant. Straight broke loose her angry tongue,<br />
And loud she storm'd:&mdash;“Advantage much I gain<br />
“By endless railing at unfaithful Jove!<br />
“This harlot will I find,&mdash;and, if with truth<br />
“They potent Juno stile me, she shall die.<br />
“Destruction shall o'erwhelm her, if beseems<br />
“My hand the sparkling sceptre of the sky:<br />
“If queen I am to Jove;&mdash;if sister;&mdash;wife:&mdash;<br />
“His sister doubtless am I, if no more.<br />
“Content perchance is Semelé to joy<br />
<a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;98]</span>
“In pleasures briefly tasted; and my wrongs<br />
“Though deep, not lasting. No!&mdash;she must conceive<br />
“Foul aggravation of her shameless deed!<br />
“Her swelling womb unblushing proves her crime:<br />
“By Jove she longs to be a mother hail'd;<br />
“Which scarcely I can boast. Such faith her pride,<br />
“In conscious beauty places. Trust me not,<br />
“Or she mistaken proves. As I am child<br />
“Of hoary Saturn, she shall sink o'erwhelm'd<br />
“By her own Jove; and dip in Stygian waves.”<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, and starting from her regal throne,<br />
Wrapt in a dusky cloud descended; o'er<br />
The threshold stepp'd of Semelé, nor chas'd<br />
Her darkening veil, till like an ancient dame<br />
She stood display'd. White hairs her temples strew'd;<br />
Deep furrows plough'd her skin; her bending limbs<br />
Quiver'd beneath her weight; her tremulous voice<br />
Exhausted age betray'd: she stood to view<br />
Old Beroë, from Epidaurus come,<br />
The nurse of Semelé. With tedious tales<br />
She garrulous amus'd:&mdash;when in her turn<br />
Listening, the name of Jupiter she heard<br />
She sigh'd, and said,&mdash;“May he be truly Jove!<br />
“But age is still suspicious. Chastest beds<br />
“Have been by these pretended gods defil'd:<br />
“For if the deity supreme he be,<br />
<a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;99]</span>
“Why comes he thus disguis'd? If true his love,<br />
“Why prove it not? Urge thou an anxious wish<br />
“To clasp him in his might, in such a sort,<br />
“As lofty Juno he embraces;&mdash;round<br />
“Begirt with all the ensigns of his power.”<br />
Thus Juno artful, Semelé's desires<br />
Apt moulded to her mind. From Jove she prays<br />
A nameless boon: the ready god consents;&mdash;<br />
“Chuse what thou wilt, nor least denial dread:<br />
“To prove my faith, I call the Stygian streams<br />
“To witness, terror of the god of gods.”<br />
Joy'd at her fatal prayer's too large success;<br />
And by her lover's prompt compliance, doom'd<br />
To sure destruction;&mdash;“This,” said she, “I wish;&mdash;<br />
“When with me next you love's delights enjoy,<br />
“Appear as when Saturnia fills your arms.”<br />
Fain would the god have stopp'd her mouth:&mdash;too soon<br />
The hasty words found entrance to his ears.<br />
Deep mourn'd he. Equal now the fates forbid,<br />
The wish retracted, or the oath absolv'd.<br />
Sorrowing he seeks the lofty heaven: his nod<br />
Dark rolling clouds collects: here form black showers;<br />
And hurricanes; and flashing lightenings mixt;<br />
Thunders; and his inevitable bolt:<br />
Anxious he strives with all his power to damp,<br />
The fierceness of his flames: nor arm'd him now,<br />
With those dread fires that to the earth dash'd down<br />
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;100]</span>
The hundred-handed foe:&mdash;too powerful they.<br />
He chose a milder thunder;&mdash;less of rage,<br />
Of fire, and fury, had the Cyclops given<br />
The mass when forg'd; a second-rated bolt.<br />
Clad in mild glory thus, the dome he seeks<br />
Of Semelé;&mdash;her mortal frame too weak,<br />
To bear th' ethereal shock, fierce scorcht she sunk,<br />
Beneath the nuptial grant. Th' imperfect babe,<br />
Snatcht from his mother's smoking womb, was sew'd<br />
(If faith the tale deserves) within his thigh;<br />
There to complete the period of his growth.<br />
Ino, his aunt maternal, then receiv'd<br />
The boy; in private rear'd him, till the nymphs<br />
Of Nysa's mountains, in their secret caves<br />
Shelter'd, and fed with milk, th' entrusted charge.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the rash promise caus'd on earth those deeds,<br />
And twice-born Bacchus' cradle safe was hid;<br />
'Tis said that Jove with heavenly nectar flush'd,<br />
All serious cares dismiss'd. With sportive jests,<br />
At ease conversing, he and Juno sate:<br />
When he:&mdash;“The thrilling ecstasies of love,<br />
“Are surely strongest on the female side.”<br />
She differs,&mdash;and the question both agree<br />
Tiresias, who each sex had prov'd, shall judge.<br />
Two mighty snakes he spy'd upon the grass,<br />
Twisted in Venus' wreaths; and with his staff<br />

Hard smote them;&mdash;instant alter'd was his sex.<br />
Wonderous! he woman of a man became,<br />
Seven winters so he liv'd:&mdash;the eight, again<br />
He spy'd the same; and cry'd,&mdash;“If such your power,<br />
“That whoso strikes you must their gender change,<br />
“Once more I'll try the spell.” Straight as the blow<br />
The snakes receiv'd, his pristine form return'd:<br />
Hence was he chosen, in the strife jocose,<br />
As umpire; and the words of Jove confirm'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much, say they, Juno rag'd; more than beseem'd<br />
The trivial cause, or sentence justly given;<br />
And veil'd the judge's eyes in endless night.<br />
But Jove omnipotent, him gave to know,<br />
(For fate forbids to cancel others' deeds)<br />
What future times conceal; a light divine;<br />
An honor'd gift to mitigate his pain.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fam'd far and wide through all B&oelig;otia's towns,<br />
Unerring answers still the prophet gave,<br />
To all who sought him. Blue Liriopé,<br />
First prov'd his faith, and ne'er-deceiving words.<br />
Her once Cephisus, in his winding stream<br />
Entwin'd, and forceful in his waves enjoy'd.<br />
The beauteous nymph's full womb, in time produc'd<br />
A babe, whose features ev'n from birth inspir'd<br />
Th' attendant nymphs with love; Narcissus nam'd.<br />

For him enquiring, whether doom'd to see,<br />
The peaceful period of maturest age,<br />
The fate-foretelling prophet thus reply'd:&mdash;<br />
“Yes,&mdash;if himself he never knows.” The words<br />
Were long absurd esteem'd: but well th' event<br />
Their justice prov'd; his strange unheard of death;<br />
And love of object never lov'd before.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now sixteen summers had Narcissus seen,<br />
A boy in beauty, but in growth a man;<br />
And crowds of youths his friendship sought, and crowds<br />
Of damsels sought his love: but fiercely pride<br />
Swell'd in his snowy bosom; and he spurn'd<br />
His friends' advances, and the love-sick maids.<br />
A chattering nymph, resounding Echo, saw<br />
The youth, when in his toils the trembling deer<br />
He drove;&mdash;a nymph who ne'er her words retain'd,<br />
Nor dialogue commenc'd. But then she bore<br />
A body palpable; and not, as now,<br />
Merely a voice:&mdash;yet garrulous, she then<br />
That voice, nor other us'd; 'twas all she could,<br />
The closing words of speakers to repeat.<br />
Juno had this ordain'd: for oft the dame<br />
The frailer nymphs upon the hills had caught,<br />
In trespass with her Jove; but Echo sly<br />
With lengthen'd speech the goddess kept amus'd,<br />
Till all by flight were sav'd. Soon Juno saw<br />
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;103]</span>
The trick:&mdash;“The power of that delusive tongue,”&mdash;<br />
She cry'd, “I'll lessen, and make brief thy words;”<br />

As roves Narcissus, Echo sees, and burns;<br />
Steals in his footsteps, following close, but flames<br />
More fierce, more near approaching. Sudden thus,<br />
The sulphurous daubing o'er the torches spread,<br />
Snatches th' approaching flame. How oft she wish'd<br />
With bland and soothing words to hail the youth;<br />
But nature harsh forbids, nor grants to make<br />
The first commencement; what she grants she takes,<br />
And anxious waits to catch the wish'd-for sounds;<br />
And speak responsive. Chance the youth had led<br />
Far from his social troop, and loud he cry'd,&mdash;<br />
“Who's he that hither comes?” Attentive she,&mdash;<br />
Reply'd, “O hither come!” Amaz'd he stood,<br />
Round searching whence the voice; and louder still,<br />
“Here come!” exclaim'd,&mdash;and Echo answer'd,&mdash;“Come!”<br />
To every part his eyes in vain are bent;<br />
And, “why,” laments he, “dost thou me avoid?”<br />
Again he hears her,&mdash;“dost thou me avoid?”<br />
Still he persists; th' alternate voice deceives,&mdash;<br />
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;104]</span>
And,&mdash;“come, approach, together let us join,”<br />
Impatient now he utters: ardent she<br />
Exclaims, in joyful accents,&mdash;“let us join!”<br />
Her wish in person urging, from the grove<br />
She springs, and wide extends her arms to clasp<br />
His neck:&mdash;Narcissus flies, and flying calls,&mdash;<br />
“Desist!&mdash;hold off thy hands;&mdash;may sooner death<br />
“Me seize, than thou enjoy me.” Nought the maid<br />
Re-echoes, but,&mdash;“enjoy me.” Close conceal'd,<br />
By him disdain'd, amid the groves she hides<br />
Her blushing forehead, where the leaves bud thick;<br />
And dwells in lonely caverns. Still her flame<br />
Clings close around her heart; and sharper pangs<br />
Repulse occasions: cares unceasing waste<br />
Her wretched form: gaunt famine shrivels up<br />
Her skin; and all the moistening juice which fed<br />
Her body, flies in air: her voice and bones<br />
Alone are left: her voice, unchang'd;&mdash;her bones<br />
To craggy stones are harden'd. Still in groves<br />
She hides secluded; nor on hills appears:<br />
Heard frequent; only heard, and nought but sound.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus slighted he the nymph; nor her alone,<br />
But numbers else who o'er the mountains rov'd;<br />
Or sported in the waves. Nor less his pride,<br />
When more mature: keen smarting from his scorn,<br />
To heaven one rais'd her hands, and ardent pray'd;&mdash;<br />
<a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;105]</span>
“Ordain that he may love, but love like me<br />
“One ne'er to be enjoy'd!” Rhamnusia grants<br />
To prayers so just, th' assenting nod. There stood,<br />
A mudless pool, whose waters silvery bright,<br />
The shepherds touch'd not,&mdash;nor the mountain goats,<br />
Nor lowing herds: which birds, and fierce wild beasts,<br />
Dabbling disturb'd not:&mdash;nor a wither'd branch,<br />
Dropt from a tree o'erhanging. Round the brink,<br />
Fed by the moisture, virid grass arose;<br />
And trees impervious to the solar beam,<br />
Screen'd the cool surface. Weary'd with the chase,<br />
And faint with heat, here laid Narcissus down;<br />
Charm'd with the place, and tempted by the pool.<br />
Here as he seeks to quench his burning thirst,<br />
He burns with other fires: and while he drinks,<br />
<a name="page105quote"></a>Caught by the image of his beauteous face,<br />
He loves th' unbody'd form: a substance thinks<br />
The shadow:&mdash;loves enraptur'd,&mdash;loves himself!<br />
Fixes with eager gaze upon the sight<br />
As on a face in Parian marble wrought.<br />
Stretcht on the ground, his own bright eyes he views,<br />
Twin stars;&mdash;his fingers, such as Bacchus grace;<br />
His tresses like Apollo's;&mdash;downy cheeks,<br />
Unbearded yet; his neck as ivory white;<br />
The roseate blooming fading into snow:<br />
Each trait admiring which the hapless nymphs,<br />
In him admir'd. Unwitting youth, himself<br />
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;106]</span>
He wants;&mdash;at once beloving, and belov'd:<br />
Himself desiring, by himself desir'd:<br />
Burning with love, while by himself he burns.<br />
Oft, stooping, were his fruitless kisses given:<br />
Oft were his arms outstretch'd to clasp the neck<br />
So plainly seen beneath the waters. No!&mdash;<br />
Himself he could not clasp. Whom he beholds,<br />
He knows not; but for whom he sees he burns.<br />
The error that his eye deceives, provokes<br />
His rage. O, foolish youth! why vainly grasp<br />
A fleeting shadow? What thou seek'st is not:&mdash;<br />
And what thou lov'st thou now destroy'st:&mdash;thou see'st<br />
A semblance only;&mdash;a reflected shade&mdash;<br />
Nought of itself: with thee it came;&mdash;with thee<br />
It stays;&mdash;and with thee, if thou could'st, would go.<br />
Not hunger's power has force to drag him thence;<br />
Nor cares of sleep oppress him. Thrown along<br />
The shaded grass, he bends insatiate eyes<br />
Tow'rds the fallacious beauty;&mdash;by those eyes<br />
He perishes. Now half-uprais'd, his arms<br />
Outspread, to all the groves around he cry'd:&mdash;<br />
“Ye woods, whose darken'd shades so oft have given<br />
“Convenient privacies to lovers, say,<br />
“Saw you e'er one so cruelly who lov'd?<br />
“In ages heap'd on ages you have stood,<br />
“Remember ye a youth who pin'd as I?<br />
“Pleas'd with the object, I its form behold;<br />
<a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;107]</span>
“But what I see, and what so pleases flies.<br />
“I find it not: in such bewilder'd maze<br />
“The lover stands. And what my grief augments,<br />
“No mighty seas divide us; lengthen'd roads;<br />
“Nor lofty hills; nor high embattled walls,<br />
“With portals clos'd: asunder are we held<br />
“By trivial drops of water. It no less<br />
“Than I, would give th' embrace; for when I bend<br />
“My lips to kiss it in the limpid stream;<br />
“With rising lips to meet, it anxious strives:<br />
“Then might you think we touch, so faint a line<br />
“Sunders us lovers. Come! whate'er thou art,<br />
“Come hither! why thus mock me, dearest form?<br />
“Why fly my wooing thus? My beauty sure,<br />
“Nor youth are such as should provoke thy flight:<br />
“For numerous nymphs for me have burn'd. Some hope<br />
“Thy kindly sympathizing face affords;<br />
“And when my anxious arms I stretch,&mdash;thy arms<br />
“Advance to clasp me:&mdash;when I smile, thou smil'st:<br />
“And often have I noted, when the tears<br />
“Stream'd down my cheeks, a rivulet on thine:<br />
“I nod,&mdash;thou, answering, noddest: and those lips,<br />
“Those beauteous lips, whose movements plain I see,<br />
“Words utter sure to mine,&mdash;though I forbid,<br />
“The sounds to hear. In thee am I!&mdash;no more<br />

“Myself torment. What hope? be woo'd,&mdash;or woo?<br />
“Wooing, or being woo'd, where is my gain?<br />
“Myself I wish, and plenty makes me poor.<br />
“Would that my body from itself could part!<br />
“Strange wish for lovers, what most dear they love,<br />
“Absent to pray. Grief undermines my strength;<br />
“Nor long my life can linger;&mdash;immature,<br />

“Can death infuse, of all my woes the end;<br />
“Might I but leave this lovely object, still<br />
“Existing: now two images, alas!<br />
“Sink with one soul in death.” Narcissus wails;<br />
And raving turns to view the face again.<br />
His tears the waters trouble; and the face<br />
So beauteous, scarce is seen. Griev'd, he exclaims,<br />
When disappearing,&mdash;“Whither fly'st thou? stay&mdash;<br />
“Stay, I beseech thee; cruel, fly me not,&mdash;<br />
“Thy lover: grant me still to view the form,<br />
“To touch forbidden:&mdash;food, at least, afford<br />
“To this unhappy flame.” Lamenting thus,<br />
He from his shoulders tore his robe, and beat<br />
With snow-white hands his bosom; at the blow<br />
His bosom redden'd: so the cherry seems,<br />
Here ruddy blushing, there as fair as snow:<br />
Or grapes unripe, part purpling to the sun,<br />
In vary'd clusters. This he soon espy'd,<br />
Reflected in the placid pool; no more<br />
<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;109]</span>
He bore it, but as gentle fire dissolves<br />
The yellow wax: as Ph&oelig;bus' morning beams<br />
Melt the light hoar;&mdash;so wasted he,&mdash;by love<br />
Gradual consum'd, as by a secret fire.<br />
No more the ruddy teints appear, with white<br />
Soft blended. All his active strength decays;<br />
And all that pleas'd so lately. Ev'n his form<br />
So much by Echo lov'd, no more remains.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Echo saw; and though of former slights<br />
Still mindful, griev'd; and when the hapless youth<br />
“Alas!” exclaim'd; responsive sigh'd, “Alas!”<br />
When on his breast the blows resounded; blows<br />
Loud answering his were heard. His final words,<br />
Gazing still earnest on the wonted wave,<br />
Were,&mdash;“dearest form, belov'd in vain!”&mdash;the words<br />
Resounded from the grove: “farewel,” he cry'd,<br />
And Echo cry'd, “farewel.” Weary'd he threw,<br />
On the green turf his head. Night clos'd his eyes;<br />
Their owner fond admiring. Now retir'd<br />
To regions far beneath, the Stygian lake<br />
Reflects his form. The Naiäd sisters wail,<br />
Shorn of their tresses, which to him they throw:<br />
The Dryads also mourn; their bosoms beat;<br />
And Echo answers every tearful groan.<br />
A pile they build; the high-tost torches bring;<br />
And funeral bier; but, lo! the corpse is gone:<br />
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;110]</span>
A saffron-teinted flower alone is found,<br />
Rising encircled with its snowy leaves.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' adventure spread through all the Achaian towns,<br />
And much repute th' unerring augur gain'd.<br />
Great now his prophesying fame. Alone,<br />
Pentheus despis'd him;&mdash;(he the gods despis'd)<br />
And only he;&mdash;he mock'd each holy word<br />
Sagely prophetic:&mdash;with his rayless eyes<br />
Reproach'd him. Angrily, his temples hoar<br />
With reverend locks, the prophet shook, and said;&mdash;<br />
“Happy for thee, if thus of light bereft,<br />
“The Bacchanalian orgies ne'er to see!<br />
“The day approaches, nor far distant now;<br />
“My sight prophetic tells,&mdash;when here will come<br />
“Bacchus new-born, of Semelé the son,<br />
“Whose rites, if thou with honor due, not tend'st<br />
“In temples worthy,&mdash;scatter'd far and wide,<br />
“Thy limbs dismember'd shall the ground bestrew:<br />
“Thy blood the forests shall distain;&mdash;thy gore<br />
“Thy aunts,&mdash;nay e'en thy mother, shall pollute:<br />
“For thou such honors, as immortals claim,<br />
“Shalt to the god deny; then wilt thou find<br />
“Beneath this darkness I but see too well.”<br />
Thus speaking, Echion's son the prophet push'd<br />
Harshly away; but his too faithful words<br />
Time prov'd;&mdash;the threaten'd deeds accomplish'd all.<br />
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;111]</span>

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! Bacchus comes, and all the country rings<br />
With joyous outcries; crowds on crowds thick swarm;&mdash;<br />
Matrons, and wives new-wedded, mixt with men;<br />
Nobles, and commons; all the impulse bears,<br />
To join the stranger's rites. But Pentheus thus;&mdash;<br />
“Offspring of Mars! O nation, serpent born!<br />
“What madness fills your minds? Can piercing sounds<br />
“Of brass from brass rebounding; winding horns,<br />
“And magic cheatings, then possess such power?<br />
“You whom the warlike sword, the trumpet's clang,<br />
“And battle's edge, dread bristling close with arms,<br />
“Appal not; yield ye thus to female howls;<br />
“Wine's maddening fumes; a filthy shameless crowd;<br />
“And empty cymbals? In amaze, I see,<br />
“You venerable men who plough'd the seas,<br />
“And here, a refuge for your exil'd gods,<br />
“This second Tyre have built,&mdash;without a blow,<br />
“Yield it a spoil! Ye too, robuster youths,<br />
“Of hardier age, and years more near my own;&mdash;<br />
“Whom warlike arms, than Thyrsi more become;<br />
“And brows with helmets than with leaves comprest:<br />
“Think whence you sprang, and let the thought inspire<br />
“Your souls with all the dragon's fierceness: he<br />
Singly slew hosts: he for his fountain fell;<br />
You for your honor vanquish. He destroy'd<br />
The valiant; you th' effeminate expel;<br />
And all the glory of your sire regain.<br />
<a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;112]</span>
“If fate to Thebes a speedy fall decrees,<br />
“May heroes, O, ye gods! with battering force<br />
“O'erturn her walls;&mdash;may the sword rage, and flames<br />
“Crackling, devour her. Wretched though our lot;<br />
“Not criminal: our fate, though much bemoan'd,<br />
“Would need concealment not: tears then might flow,<br />
“But not from shame. Now unresisting Thebes,<br />
“Yields to a boy unarm'd; who never joys<br />
“In armies, steeds, nor swords;&mdash;but more in locks<br />
“With myrrh moist-dropping, garlands soft, and robes<br />
“Of various teints, with gold and purple gay.<br />
“Rest ye but tranquil, and without delay,<br />
“Him will I force to own his boasted sire<br />
“Untrue; and forg'd those new invented rites.<br />
“Had not Acrisius bravery to despise<br />
“The counterfeited deity, and close<br />
“The gates of Argos on him? And must now<br />
“This wanderer come, and Pentheus terrify,<br />
“With all the power of Thebes! Haste, quickly haste,”&mdash;<br />
He bade his servants,&mdash;“hither drag, firm chain'd,<br />
“This leader. Quick, nor brook my words delay!”<br />
His grandsire, Athamas, and all the crowd<br />
Reprove;&mdash;while thus he rails, with fruitless toil<br />
Labor to stop him. Obstinate he stands,<br />

Restrain'd, increases; goading more and more;<br />
Restraint itself enkindling more his rage.<br />

So may be seen a river rolling smooth,<br />
With murmuring nearly silent, while unchecked;<br />
But when by rocks, or bulky trees oppos'd,<br />
Foaming and boiling furious, on it sweeps<br />
Impetuous raging; fiercer, more withstood.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With blood besmear'd, his men return;&mdash;their lord<br />

“His train, and joins his rites.” (The Tuscans once<br />
The Bacchanalian orgies follow'd.) Bound<br />
Behind, his hands, their prisoner they present.<br />
Pentheus survey'd the stranger, while his eyes<br />
Sparkled with rage terrific: with constraint<br />
His torture so deferring, thus he spoke;&mdash;<br />

“A public warning,&mdash;tell thy name;&mdash;confess<br />

“Lands by strong oxen plough'd, or wool-clad flocks,<br />

Stubborn, the son of Echion still persists;<br />

His rage, to hear the clangor. Clear'd from trees,<br />
A plain extends, from every part fair seen,<br />
And near the mountain's centre: round its skirt,<br />
Thick groves grow shady. Here his mother saw<br />
His eye unhallow'd view the sacred rites;<br />

Furious the Thyrsus at her Pentheus flung:<br />

And all pursue the now pale trembling wretch.<br />
No longer fierce he storms; but grieving blames<br />
His rashness, and his obstinacy owns.<br />
Wounded,&mdash;“dear aunt, Autonoë!”&mdash;he cries,<br />
“Help me!&mdash;O, let your own Actæon's ghost<br />
“Move you to pity!” She, Actæon's name<br />
Nought heeding, tears his outstretcht arm away;<br />
The other, Ino from his body drags!<br />
And when his arms, unhappy wretch, he tries<br />
To lift unto his mother, arms to lift<br />
Were none;&mdash;but stretching forth his mangled trunk<br />
Of limbs bereft;&mdash;“look, mother!”&mdash;he exclaims.<br />

Loud howl'd Agavé at the sight; his neck<br />
Fierce grasping,&mdash;toss'd on high his streaming locks,<br />
Her bloody fingers twisted in his hair.<br />
Then clamor'd loudly;&mdash;“joy, my comrades, joy!<br />

The vine: what now were threads, curl'd tendrils seem:<br />
Shot from the folded web, the branches climb;<br />
And the bright red in purpling grapes appears.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now was the sun declining, and approach'd<br />
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;146]</span>
The twilight season, when nor day it seems,<br />
Nor night confirm'd; but a gray mixture forms;<br />
Of each an indetermin'd compound. Deep<br />
The roof appear'd to shade; the oily lamps,<br />
Ardent to glow; the torches bright to burn,<br />
With reddening flames; while round them seem'd to howl,<br />
Figures of beast ferocious. Fill'd with smoke<br />
The room,&mdash;th' affrighted maidens seek to hide;<br />
And each in different corners tries to shun<br />
The fires and flaming light. But while they seek<br />
A lurking shelter, o'er their shorten'd limbs<br />
A webby membrane spreading, binds their arms<br />
In waving wings. The gloom conceal'd the mode,<br />
Of transformation from their former shape.<br />
Light plumage bears them not aloft,&mdash;yet rais'd<br />
On wings transparent, through the air they skim,<br />
To speak they strive, but utter forth a sound<br />
Feeble and weak; then, screeching shrill, they plain:<br />
Men's dwellings they frequent,&mdash;nor try the woods;<br />
And, cheerful day avoiding, skim by night;<br />
Their name from that untimely hour deriv'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now were the deeds of heaven-born Bacchus fam'd<br />
Through every part of Thebes; and all around,<br />
His aunt proud boasts the new-made god's great power:<br />
She, of the sisters all, from sorrow spar'd,<br />
Save what to view her sisters' sorrowing gave.<br />
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;147]</span>
Juno beheld her lofty thus, her breast<br />
Elate to view her sons; her nuptial fruits<br />
With Athamas; and her great foster child,<br />
The mighty Bacchus. More the furious queen<br />
Bore not, but thus exclaim'd;&mdash;“Has the whore's son<br />
“Power to transform the Tyrrhene crew, and plunge<br />
“Them headlong in the deep? Can he impel<br />
“The mother's hands to seize her bleeding son<br />
“And tear his entrails? Dares he then to clothe<br />
“The Minyëid sisters with un'custom'd wings?<br />
“And is Saturnia's utmost power confin'd<br />
“Wrongs unreveng'd to weep? Suffices such<br />
“For me? Is this a goddess' utmost might?<br />
“But he instructs me;&mdash;wisdom may be taught<br />
“Ev'n by a foe. The wretched Pentheus' fate,<br />
“Shews all-sufficient, what may madness do.<br />
“Why should not Ino, stung with frantic rage,<br />
“The well-known track her sisters trode pursue?”<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A path declivitous, with baleful yew<br />
Dark shaded, leads, a dreary silent road,<br />
Down to th' infernal regions: sluggish Styx<br />
Dank mists exhales: here travel new-made ghosts,<br />
With rites funereal blest: pale winter's gloom<br />
Wide rules the squalid place: the stranger shades<br />
Wander, unknowing which the path to tread,<br />
Straight to the infernal city, where is held<br />
<a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;148]</span>
Black Pluto's savage court. A thousand gates,<br />
Wide ope, surround the town on every side.<br />
As boundless ocean every stream receives,<br />
From earth pour'd numerous,&mdash;so each wandering soul<br />
Flocks to this city; whose capacious bounds<br />
Full space for all affords; nor ever feels<br />
Th' increasing crowd: of flesh depriv'd, and bones,<br />
The bloodless shadows wander. Some frequent<br />
The forum; some th' infernal monarch's court;<br />
Some various arts employ, resembling much<br />
Their former daily actions; numbers groan<br />
In punishments severe. Here Juno came,<br />
Braving the region's horrors, from her throne<br />
Celestial,&mdash;so did ire and hatred goad<br />
Her bosom with their stings! Sacred she press'd<br />
The groaning threshold,&mdash;instant as she stepp'd,<br />
Fierce Cerberus his triple head uprais'd,<br />
And howl'd with triple throat. The goddess calls<br />
The night-born sisters, fierce, implacable:<br />
Before the close-barr'd adamantine gates<br />
They sit; their tresses twisting round with snakes.<br />
The queen through clouds of midnight gloom they see,<br />
And instant rise. Here dwell the suffering damn'd.<br />
Here Tityus, stretcht o'er nine wide acres, yields<br />
His entrails to be torn. Thou, Tantalus,<br />
Art seen, the stream forbid to taste;&mdash;the fruit<br />
Thy lips o'erhanging, flies! Thou, Sisyphus,<br />
<a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;149]</span>
Thy stone pursuing downwards; or its weight<br />
Straining aloft, with oft exerted power!<br />
Ixion whirling, too; with swift pursuit,<br />
Thou follow'st, and art follow'd! Belides!<br />
Your husband-cousins who in death dar'd steep,<br />
And ceaseless draw the unavailing streams!<br />
All Juno view'd with unrelenting brow;<br />
But, view'd Ixion sterner far than all:<br />
And when on Sisyphus again she cast<br />
Her eyes, behind Ixion, angry cry'd;&mdash;<br />
“What justice this?&mdash;of all the brethren he<br />
“Sharp torture suffers! Shall proud Athamas<br />
“A regal dwelling boast,&mdash;whose scornful taunts,<br />
“And scornful spouse have still my power contemn'd?”<br />
Then straight her hatred's cause disclos'd. They see<br />
Her journey's object, and revenge's aim.<br />
This her desire, that Cadmus' regal house<br />
Perish'd should sink; and Athamas, fierce urg'd<br />
By madness should some dreadful vengeance claim.<br />
Commands, solicitations, prayers,&mdash;at once<br />
The goddesses besiege: and as she speaks,<br />
Angrily mov'd, Tisiphoné replies,&mdash;<br />
(Shaking her hoary locks,&mdash;the twining snakes<br />
Back from her mouth repelling) hasty thus;&mdash;<br />
“A tedious tale we need not; what thou wilt<br />
“Believe accomplish'd. Fly this hateful gloom;&mdash;<br />
“Up to the wholesome breeze of heaven repair.”<br />
<a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;150]</span>
Glad, Juno left the spot;&mdash;when near approach'd<br />
Heaven's entrance, there Thaumantian Iris met,<br />
And with her sprinklings purify'd the queen.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick now Tisiphoné, the savage fiend,<br />
Seizes her torch, with gory droppings wet;<br />
Flings round her limbs a garment, deeply dy'd<br />
With streaming blood; a twisting snake supplies<br />
A girdle:&mdash;thus array'd she sallies forth,<br />
Follow'd by loud lament, by terror, fear,<br />
And quivering-featur'd madness. When she press'd<br />
The threshold, fame declares the pillars shook;<br />
The maple doors, with terror mov'd, grew pale:<br />
Back shrunk the sun! Ino, with trembling dread<br />
Beheld these wonders;&mdash;Athamas beheld;<br />
And both prepar'd the haunted place to fly.<br />
Escape the fury hinders: fierce she stands,<br />
Blocking the entrance: wide her arms she spreads,<br />
With viperous twistings bound; and threatening shakes<br />
Her tresses: loud the serpents noise, disturb'd;<br />
Sprawl o'er her shoulders some; some, lower fall'n,<br />
Twine hissing round her breasts, with brandish'd tongue,<br />
Black poison vomiting. With furious gripe,<br />
Two from her locks she tore;&mdash;her deadly hand<br />
Hurl'd them straight on; the breasts of Athamas,<br />
And Ino, hungry, with their fangs they seiz'd;<br />
Fierce pains infixing, but external wounds<br />
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;151]</span>
Their limbs betray'd not: mental was the blow,<br />
So direly struck. Venoms most mortal, too,<br />
From Tartarus she bore:&mdash;the foam high-churn'd<br />
From jaws of Cerberus; the poisonous juice<br />
Of Hydra; urgent wish for roaming wide;<br />
Oblivion mental-blinded; wicked deeds;<br />
Weeping; and furious fierceness, slaughter fond.<br />
On these commingled, fresh-drawn gore she pour'd,<br />
And warm'd them bubbling in a brazen vase;<br />
Stirr'd by a sprouting hemlock. Trembling, they<br />
Shudder, while in their breasts the poison fierce<br />
She pours: both bosoms feel it deep instill'd;&mdash;<br />
Their inmost vitals feel it. Then her torch,<br />
Whirl'd flaming round and round, in triumph glares,<br />
Fires from the circling gathering. Powerful thus;<br />
Victorious in her aims, and deeds desir'd,<br />
To mighty Pluto's shadowy realm she speeds;<br />
And from her loins untwists the girding snakes.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mad bounded Athamas amid the hall,<br />
“Ho! friends,” exclaiming;&mdash;“here spread wide your toils,<br />
“Here, in this thicket, where ev'n now I saw<br />
“With young twin cubs, a lioness!”&mdash;and mad,<br />
Pursu'd his consort for a savage beast;<br />
Snatching Learchus, who with playful smile,<br />
Outstretch'd his infant hands to meet him. Torne<br />
Rough from his mother's bosom, round in air<br />
<a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;152]</span>
And round, sling-like he whirl'd; then savage dash'd<br />
Upon a rugged rock the tender bones.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud howls the frantic mother; frantic made<br />
By grief, or by the scatter'd poison's power:<br />
And, raving, with dishevell'd tresses spread<br />
Wide o'er her shoulders, flies. Her naked arms<br />
Young Melicertes bear; madly she shrieks;&mdash;<br />
“Evoë, Bacchus!”&mdash;Loud at Bacchus' name<br />
Revengeful Juno laugh'd, and said;&mdash;“Such boon<br />
“Thy foster-son upon his nurse confers!”<br />
A lofty rock the foaming waves o'erhangs,<br />
Whose dashing force deep in its base have scoop'd<br />
A cavern, safely sheltering from the showers:<br />
The adamantine summit high extends,<br />
And o'er the wide main stretches. Swift this height,<br />
Active and strong with madness, Ino gain'd<br />

Sprung from the cliff, and sunk beneath the waves.<br />

Assenting to her prayer; and from their limbs<br />
Abstracts the mortal portion; on their forms<br />
Breathes majesty; and with their alter'd mien,<br />
Their names he changes too; Palæmon he,<br />
Now stil'd, his mother as Leucothoë known.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess' anxious comrades trac'd her steps<br />
With care; the last with arduous search they found,<br />
Just on the giddy brink, nor dubious deem'd<br />
Her fate a moment. Cadmus' house they wail;<br />
With beating hands their tresses tear, and robes;<br />
And highly Juno blame, as one unjust:<br />
Too ireful for the hapless sister's fault.<br />
Juno, fierce flaming, these reproaches stung;&mdash;<br />
“Ye too,” she cry'd, “shall monuments become<br />
“Of the fierce ire ye blame!” Deeds words pursu'd.<br />
The nymph who most her hapless queen held dear,<br />
Exclaim'd;&mdash;“deep in the roaring main I'll plunge,<br />
“To join her fate,”&mdash;and sprung to take the leap;<br />
But motionless she stood,&mdash;fixt to the rock!<br />
Her wounding blows, upon her bosom one<br />
Strives to renew, as wont; her striving arms<br />

Stiffen'd to stone she sees. This tow'rd the waves<br />
Her hands extends; a rocky mass she stands,<br />
In the same waves far stretching. Lifted high,<br />
The locks to rend, the fingers might be seen<br />
Stiffen'd, and rigid with the hair become.<br />
In posture whatsoever caught, each nymph,<br />
In that same posture stands. Thus part are chang'd:<br />
The rest, to birds transform'd, by wings upborne,<br />
Skim o'er the surface of the neighbouring sea.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cadmus, the wond'rous change which rais'd his child,<br />
And his young grandson to the rank of gods,<br />
Yet knew not. By his load of grief o'erwhelm'd;<br />
A chain of woes; and supernatural scenes,<br />
So numerous which he sees; the founder quits<br />
His town, suspicious that the city's fate,<br />
And not his own, misfortune on him showers.<br />
Borne o'er the main, his lengthen'd wanderings end,<br />
When with his exil'd consort, safe he gains<br />
Illyria's shores. Opprest with grief and age,<br />
The primal fortunes of their house, with care<br />
They scan, and in their converse all their woes<br />
Again recounting, Cadmus thus exclaims;&mdash;<br />
“Was then that serpent, by my javelin pierc'd,<br />
“When driven from Tyre; whose numerous teeth I sow'd,<br />
“Sacred to some divinity?&mdash;If he<br />
“Thus, vengeful for the deed, his anger pours,<br />

“May I a serpent stretcht at length become.”<br />
He said,&mdash;and serpent-like extended lies!<br />
Scales he perceives, upon his harden'd skin;<br />
And sees green spots on his black body form;<br />
Prone on his breast he falls; together twin'd,<br />
His legs commingling stretch, and gradual end<br />
Lessen'd in rounded point; his arms remain<br />
Still, and those arms remaining he extends;<br />
While down his face yet human tears flow fast.<br />
“O, hapless wife! approach,” he cries, “approach,<br />
“And touch me now, while ought of me remains;<br />
“Receive my hand, while yet a hand I bear;<br />
“Ere to a serpent wholly turns my form.”&mdash;<br />
More he prepar'd to utter, but his tongue,<br />
Cleft sudden, to his wishes words refus'd:<br />
And often when his sorrows sad he try'd<br />
To wail anew, he hiss'd!&mdash;that sound alone,<br />
Nature permitted. While her naked breast<br />
With blows resounded, loud his wife exclaim'd;&mdash;<br />
“Stay,&mdash;O, my Cadmus! hapless man, shake off<br />
“This monstrous figure! Cadmus what is this?<br />
“Where are thy feet,&mdash;and where thy arms and hands?<br />
“Where are thy features,&mdash;thy complexion? Where,<br />
“Whilst I bewail, art thou? Celestial powers!<br />
“Why not this transformation work on me?”<br />
She ended; he advancing, lick'd her face,<br />

And round her wonted neck embracing twin'd.<br />
Now draw their servants nigh, and as they come<br />
With terror start. The crested serpents play,<br />
Smooth on their necks,&mdash;now two; and cordial slide,<br />
In spires conjoin'd; then in the darksome shades<br />
Th' adjoining woods afford them, close they hide.<br />
Mankind they fly not, nor deep wounds inflict;<br />
Harmless, their pristine form is ne'er forgot.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, though in alter'd shapes, the pair rejoic'd<br />
Their grandson's fame to hear; whom vanquish'd Ind'<br />
Low bending worshipp'd; Greece adoring prais'd,<br />
In lofty temples. Sole Acrisius stands,<br />
Like Bacchus sprung from Jove's celestial seed,<br />
Opposing; and from Argos' gates propels<br />
The god;&mdash;his birth deny'd, against him arms.<br />
Nor Perseus would he own from heaven deriv'd;<br />
Conceiv'd by Danaë, from a golden shower:<br />
Yet soon,&mdash;so mighty is the force of truth,&mdash;<br />
Acrisius grieves he e'er so rashly brav'd<br />
The god; his grandson driving from his court,<br />
Disown'd. Now one in heaven is glorious plac'd;<br />
The other, laden with the well-known spoil<br />
Of the fierce snaky monster, cleaves the air,<br />
On sounding pinions. High the victor sails<br />
O'er Lybia's desarts, and the gory drops<br />
<a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;157]</span>
Fall from the gorgon's head; the Ground receives<br />
The blood, and warms it into writhing snakes.<br />
Hence does the country with the pest still swarm.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thence borne by adverse winds, he sweeps along,<br />
Through boundless ether driven; now here, now there,<br />
As watery clouds are swept. From lofty skies,<br />
The earth far distant viewing, round the globe<br />
He skimm'd: three times he saw the Arctic pole<br />
And thrice the warmer Crab. Oft to the west,<br />
Th' adventurous youth was borne; back to the east,<br />
As often. Now the day in darkness sank,<br />
When he, nocturnal flight mistrusting, lights<br />
In Atlas' kingdom 'neath th' Hesperian sky;<br />
A short repose requests, till Phosphor' bright,<br />
Should call Aurora forth;&mdash;she ushering in<br />
The chariot of the day. Japetus' son<br />
All men in huge corporeal bulk surpass'd.<br />
He to th' extremest confines of the land,<br />
And o'er the ocean sway'd, whose waves receive<br />
Apollo's panting steeds, and weary'd car.<br />
A thousand bleating flocks; a thousand herds,<br />
Stray'd through the royal pastures. Neighbouring lords<br />
Not near him plough'd their lands. Trees grew, whose leaves<br />
With splendor glittering, threw a golden shade<br />
O'er golden branches, and o'er fruit of gold.<br />
Thus Perseus;&mdash;“Friendly host, if glorious birth<br />
<a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;158]</span>
“Thee pleases, here one born of Jove behold.<br />
“If deeds of merit more attraction move,<br />
“Mine thy applause may claim. At present grant<br />
“An hospitable shelter here, and rest.”<br />
But Atlas, fearing these oraculous words,&mdash;<br />
(Long since by Themis on Parnassus given)<br />
“The time, O king! will come, thy golden tree<br />
“Shall lose its fruit. The glory of the spoil<br />
“A son of Jove shall boast:” and dreading sore;<br />
Around his orchards massy walls he rears;<br />
A dragon huge and fierce the guard maintains.<br />
“Whatever strangers to his realm approach,<br />
Far thence he drives; and thus to Perseus too;&mdash;<br />
“Haste, quickly haste from hence, lest soon I prove<br />
“Thy glorious deeds but feign'd,&mdash;feign'd as thy birth.”<br />
Then force to threats he added,&mdash;strove to thrust<br />
The hero forth; who struggling, efforts urg'd<br />
Resisting, while he begg'd with softening words.<br />
Proving in strength inferior (who in strength<br />
Could vie with Atlas?) “Since my fame,” he cries,<br />
“Such small desert obtains, a gift accept.”<br />
And, back his face averting, holds display'd,<br />
On his left side Medusa's ghastly head.<br />
A mountain now the mighty Atlas stands!<br />
His hair and beard as lofty forests wave;<br />
His arms and hands high hilly summits rear;<br />
O'er-topp'd above, by what was once his head:<br />
<a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;159]</span>
His bones are rocks; then, so the gods decree,<br />
Enlarg'd to size immense in every part,<br />
The weight of heaven, and all the stars he bears.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His blustering vassals Æolus had pent,<br />
In ever-during prisons. Phosphor' bright,<br />
Most splendid 'midst the starry host of heaven;<br />
Admonitor of labor, now was risen;<br />
When Perseus bound again on either foot,<br />
His winnowing wings; girt on his crooked sword;<br />
And cleft the air, on waving pinions borne.<br />
O'er numerous nations, far beneath him spread,<br />
He sail'd, till Ethiopia's realms he saw;<br />
Where Cepheus rul'd. There Ammon, power unjust,<br />
Andromeda had sentenc'd,&mdash;guiltless maid,<br />
To what her mother's boastful tongue deserv'd.<br />
Her soon as Perseus spy'd, fast by the arms<br />
Chain'd to the rugged rock;&mdash;where but her locks<br />
Wav'd lightly to the breeze; and but her eyes<br />
Trickled a tepid stream; she might be deem'd<br />
A sculptur'd marble: him the unknown sight<br />
Astonish'd, dazzled, and enflam'd with love.<br />
His senses in the beauteous view sole wrapt,<br />
Scarce he remembers on his wings to wave:&mdash;<br />
Alights, exclaiming;&mdash;“O, whom chains like these<br />
“Should never bind, nor other chains than such,<br />
“As lovers intertwist! declare thy name;<br />

“Thy country tell; and why thou bear'st those bonds.”<br />
Silent awhile the virgin stood; abash'd,<br />
Converse with man to hold: her blushing face,<br />
Her hands, if free, had long before conceal'd.<br />
Quick starting tears, 'twas all she could, her eyes<br />
Veil'd swimming: then her name and country told;<br />
And all the conscious pride her mother's charms<br />
Inspir'd, in full acknowledg'd; lest for crimes<br />
Her own, just suffering, Perseus might conceive.<br />
All yet untold, when loud the billows roar'd;<br />
Upheav'd the monster's bulk: far 'bove the waves<br />
He stood uprear'd, and then right onward plung'd;<br />
His ample bosom covering half the main.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud shrieks the virgin! Sad her father comes;<br />
And sad her raving mother, wretched both,<br />
The mother most deserv'dly. Help in vain<br />
From them she seeks; with tears, and bosoms torn,<br />
Her fetter'd limbs they clasp, they can no more.<br />
Then Perseus thus;&mdash;“for tears and loud laments,<br />
“Long may the time be: but effective aid<br />
“To give, the time is short. Suppose the nymph<br />
“I ask;&mdash;I, Perseus! sprung from mighty Jove,<br />

Lo! as a vessel's sharpen'd prow quick cleaves<br />
The waves, by strenuous sweating arms impell'd,<br />
The monster comes! his mighty bosom wide<br />
The waters sideway breasting; distant now,<br />
Not more than what the Balearic sling<br />
Could with the bullet gain, when high in air,<br />
The sod repelling, upward springs the youth.<br />
Soon as the main reflected Perseus' form,<br />
The ocean-savage rag'd: as Jove's swift bird<br />
When in the open fields a snake he spies<br />
Basking, his livid back to Ph&oelig;bus' rays<br />
Expos'd, behind attacks him; plunges deep,<br />
His hungry talons in his scaly neck,<br />
To curb the twisting of his sanguine teeth.<br />
With rapid flight, thus Perseus shooting cleaves<br />
The empty air; lights on the monster's back;<br />
Burying his weapon to the crooked hilt,<br />
Full in the shoulder of the raging beast.<br />
Mad with the deepen'd wound, now rears aloft<br />
<a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;162]</span>
The savage high in air; now plunges low,<br />
Beneath the waters; now he furious turns,<br />
As turns the boar ferocious, when the crowd<br />
Of barking dogs beset him fiercely round.<br />
With rapid waft the venturous hero shuns<br />
His greedy jaws: now on his back, thick-arm'd<br />
With shells, he strikes where opening space he sees;<br />
Now on his sides; now where his tapering tail<br />
In fish-like form is finish'd, bites the steel.<br />
High spouts the wounded monster from his mouth;<br />
The waves with gore deep purpling: drench'd, the wings<br />
Droop nagging; and no longer Perseus dares<br />
To trust their dripping aid. A rock he spies<br />
Whose summit o'er the peaceful waters rose,<br />
But deep was hid when tempests mov'd the main.<br />
Supported here, his left hand firmly grasps<br />
The craggy edge; while through his sides, and through,<br />
The dying savage feels the weapon drove.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud shouts and plaudits fill the shore, the noise<br />
Resounding echoes to the heavenly thrones.<br />
Cassiopé and Cepheus joyful greet<br />

And saviour. From her rugged fetters freed,<br />
The virgin walks; the cause, the great reward<br />

In the pure stream: then with soft leaves defends<br />
A spot, to rest the serpent-bearing head,<br />
Lest the bare sand should harm it. Twigs marine<br />
He likewise strews, and rests Medusa there.<br />
The fresh green twigs as though with life endow'd,<br />
Felt the dire Gorgon's power; their spongy pith<br />
Hard to the touch became, the stiffness spread<br />
Through every twig and leaf. The Nereïd nymphs<br />
More branches bring, and try the wonderous change<br />
On all, and joy to see the change succeed:<br />
Spreading the transformation from the seeds,<br />
With them throughout the waves. This nature still<br />
Retains the coral: hardness still assumes<br />

A bending twig; an harden'd stone above.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three turfy altars to three heavenly gods<br />
He builds: to Hermes sacred stands the left;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Love and Hymen wave their torches high,<br />

Precursive of their joys: each hearth is heap'd<br />
With odorous incense: every roof is hung<br />
With flowery garlands: pipes, and harps, and lyres,<br />
And songs which indicate their festive souls,<br />
Resound aloud. Each portal open thrown,<br />
Display'd appears the golden palace wide.<br />
By every lord of Cepheus' court, array'd<br />
In splendid pomp, the nuptial feast is grac'd.<br />
The banquet ended, while the generous gift<br />
Of Bacchus circles; and each soul dilates,<br />
Perseus, the modes and customs of the land<br />
Curious enquires. Lyncides full relates<br />
The habits, laws, and manners of the clime.<br />
His information ended;&mdash;“now,”&mdash;he cry'd,&mdash;<br />
“Relate, O Perseus! boldest of mankind,&mdash;<br />
“By what fierce courage, and what skilful arts,”<br />
“The snaky locks in thy possession came.”<br />
Then Perseus tells, how lies a lonely vale<br />
Beneath cold Atlas; every side strong fenc'd<br />
By lofty hills, whose only pass is held,<br />
By Phorcus' twin-born daughters. Mutual they<br />
One eye possess'd, in turns by either us'd.<br />
His hand deceiving seiz'd it, as it pass'd<br />
'Twixt them alternate; dexterous was the wile.<br />
Through devious paths, and deep-sunk ways he went;<br />
And craggy woods, dark-frowning, till he reach'd<br />
<a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;165]</span>
The Gorgon's dwelling: passing then the fields,<br />
And beaten roads, there forms of men he saw,<br />
And shapes of savage beasts; but all to stone<br />
By dire Medusa's petrifying face<br />
Transform'd. He then the horrid countenance mark'd,<br />
Bright from the brazen targe his left arm bore,<br />
Reflected. While deep slumber safe weigh'd down,<br />
The Gorgon and her serpents, he divorc'd<br />
Her shoulders from her head. He adds how sprung,<br />
Chrysaör, and wing'd Pegasus the swift,<br />
From the prolific Gorgon's streaming gore.<br />
Relates the perils of his lengthen'd flight;<br />
What seas, what kingdoms from the lofty sky,<br />
Beneath him he had view'd; what sparkling stars<br />
His waving wings had brush'd;&mdash;thus ceas'd his tale:<br />
All more desiring. Then uprose a peer,&mdash;<br />
And why Medusa, of the sisters sole<br />
The serpent-twisted tresses wore, enquir'd.<br />
The youth:&mdash;“The story that you ask, full well<br />
“Attention claims;&mdash;I what you seek recite.<br />
“For matchless beauty fam'd, with envying hope<br />
“Her, crowds of suitors follow'd: nought surpass'd<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wonders, while the son of Danaë tells,<br />
Circled around by Cepheus' noble troop;<br />
Sudden th' imperial hall with tumults loud<br />
Resounds. Not clamor such as oft we hear,<br />
The bridal feasts, in songs of joy attend:<br />
But what stern war announces. Much the change,<br />
(The peaceful feast to instant riot turn'd)<br />
Seem'd like the placid main, when the fierce rage<br />
Of sudden tempests lash its surges high.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Phineus stepp'd, the leader of the crowd;<br />
Soul of the riot; and his ashen spear,<br />

Arm'd with a brazen point, he brandish'd high;&mdash;<br />
“Lo, here!” he shouts, “lo, here I vengeful come<br />
“On him who claims my spouse! Not thy swift wings;<br />
“Nor cheating Jove, chang'd to a golden shower,<br />

“Then was thy spouse snatch'd from thee, when remain'd<br />
“Of help no hope; to all she lost appear'd.<br />
“Thy savage heart perhaps had ev'n rejoic'd<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought Phineus answer'd, but his furious eyes<br />
Now Perseus, now the king alternate view;<br />
Doubtful or this to pierce, or that: his pause<br />
Was short; his powerful arm, by fury nerv'd,<br />
At Perseus hurl'd the quivering spear,&mdash;in vain!<br />
Fixt in the couch it stood. Quick bounded up<br />
Th' indignant youth, and deep in Phineus' breast,<br />
Had plung'd the point returning, but he shrunk<br />
Behind an altar; which, O shame! preserv'd<br />
The impious villain. Yet not harmless sped<br />
The weapon;&mdash;full in Rhætus' front it stuck;<br />
Who lifeless dropp'd; broke in the bone the steel;<br />
He spurn'd, and sprinkled all the feast with gore.<br />
Then rag'd with ire ungovern'd all the crowd,<br />
And hurl'd in showers their weapons; some fierce cry'd,<br />
Cepheus, no less than Perseus, death deserv'd.<br />
But Cepheus left the hall, adjuring loud,<br />
The hospitable gods; justice; and faith;<br />
That he was guiltless of the sanguine fray.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minerva comes; her sheltering Ægis shields<br />
<a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;172]</span>
Her brother's body; in his breast she breathes<br />
Redoubled valor. Atys, Indian bred,<br />
Whom fair Limnaté, Ganges' daughter, bore,<br />
'Tis told, amid the waters' crystal caves,<br />
Scarce sixteen years had seen. His beauteous form,<br />
In gorgeous dress more beauteous still appear'd.<br />
A purple garment fring'd around with gold,<br />
Enwrapp'd him; round his neck were golden beads;<br />
And pins and combs of gold his lovely locks,<br />
With myrrh sweet-smelling, held. Well skill'd the youth<br />
To hurl the javelin to its distant mark;<br />
But more to bend the bow. Him Perseus smote,<br />
The flexile bow just bending, with a brand<br />
Snatch'd flaming from the altar; crush'd, his face<br />
A horrid mass of fractur'd bones appears.<br />
His beauteous features Lycabas beheld<br />
In blood convuls'd: his dearest comrade he,<br />
And one who proud his ardent love display'd.<br />
Griev'd to behold the last expiring breath,<br />
Of Atys parting from the furious wound,<br />
He seiz'd the bow the youth had bent, and cry'd;&mdash;<br />
“The battle try with me!&mdash;not long thy boast<br />
“Of conquest o'er a boy; a conquest more<br />
“By hate than fame attended.” Railing thus,<br />
The piercing weapon darted from the string.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Phineus, fearful hand to hand to meet<br />
<a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;173]</span>
The foe, his javelin hurl'd, the point ill-aim'd<br />
On Idas glanc'd, who vainly kept aloof<br />
With neutral weapon. Phineus, stern he view'd,<br />
“With threatening frown, exclaiming;&mdash;”though no share<br />
“In this mad broil I took, now, Phineus, feel<br />
“The power of him whom thou hast forc'd a foe;<br />
“And take reciprocally wound for wound.”<br />
Then from his side the weapon tore to hurl;<br />
But fast the life-stream gush'd, he instant fell.<br />
Here, by the sword of Clymenus was slain,<br />
Odites, noblest lord in Cepheus' court;<br />
Protenor fell by Hypseus; Hypseus sunk<br />
Beneath Lyncides' arm. Amid the throng<br />
Was old Emathion too, friend to the just,<br />
And fearer of the gods; though ancient years<br />
Forbade his wielding arms, what aid his words<br />
Could give, he spar'd not: curs'd the impious war,<br />
In loud upbraidings. As with trembling arms,<br />
He grasp'd the altar, Chromis' gory sword<br />
His neck divided; on the altar dropp'd<br />
The head; and there the trembling, dying tongue,<br />
Faint imprecations utter'd; 'midst the flames<br />
He breath'd his spirit forth. By Phineus' hand,<br />
Broteas and Ammon fell: the brother-twins<br />
Unconquer'd in the fight, the cæstus shower'd;<br />
Could but the cæstus make the falchion yield:<br />
<a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;174]</span>
But Perseus felt it not,&mdash;its point hung fixt<br />
Amidst his garments' folds. On him he turn'd,<br />
The falchion, glutted with Medusa's gore,<br />
And plung'd it in his breast. Dying, he looks<br />
Around, with eyes rolling in endless night,<br />
For Atys, and upon him drops: then pleas'd,<br />
Thus join'd in death, he seeks the shades below.<br />
Methion's son, Syenian Phorbas, now<br />
And fierce Amphimedon, in Lybia born,<br />
Rush in the fight to mingle; both fall prone,<br />
The slippery earth wide spread with smoking blood.<br />
The sword attacks them rising; in his throat<br />
Phorbas receives it, and the other's side.<br />
But Erythis, of Actor born, whd rear'd<br />
An axe tremendous, not the waving sword<br />
Of Perseus meets: a cup of massive bulk,<br />
With both his hands high-heaving, fierce he hurls<br />
Full on his foe: he vomits gory floods;<br />
Falls back, and strikes with dying head the earth.<br />
Then Polydæmon falls, sprung from the blood<br />
Of queen Semiramis; Lycetes brave,<br />
The son of Spercheus; Abaris, who dwelt<br />
On frozen Caucasus; and Helicen<br />
With unshorn tresses; Phlegias; Clitus too;<br />
Those with the rest beneath his weapon fall;<br />
And on the rising heaps of dead he stands.<br />
<a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;175]</span>
And fell Ampycus; Ceres' sacred priest,<br />
His temples with a snow-white fillet bound.<br />
Thou, O, Japetides! whose string to sound<br />
Such discord knew not; but whose harp still tun'd,<br />
The works of peace, in concord with thy voice;<br />
Wast bidden here to celebrate the feast:<br />
And cheer the nuptial banquet with thy song!<br />
Him, when at distance Pettalus beheld,<br />
Handling his peaceful instrument, he cry'd<br />
In mocking laughter;&mdash;“go, and end thy song,<br />
“Amid the Stygian ghosts,”&mdash;and instant plung'd<br />
Through his left temple, his too deadly sword.<br />
Sinking, his dying fingers caught the strings,<br />
And, chance-directed, gave a mournful sound.<br />
Not long the fierce Lycormas saw his fall<br />
Without revenge: a massy bar of oak<br />
From the right gate he tore, and on the bones<br />
Behind the neck, the furious blow was aim'd:<br />
Prone on the earth, like a crush'd ox he fell.<br />
Pelates of Cinypheus, strove to rend<br />
A like strong fastening from th' opposing door;<br />
The dart of Corythus his tugging hand<br />
Transfix'd, and nail'd him to the wood confin'd:<br />
Here Abas, with his spear, deep pierc'd his side:<br />
Nor dying fell he;&mdash;by the hand retain'd,<br />
Firm to the post he hung. Melaneus fell.<br />
The arms of Perseus aiding; Dorilas,<br />
<a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;176]</span>
The wealthiest lord in Nasamonia's land,<br />
Fell too beside him: rich was he in fields;<br />
In wide extent no lands with his could vie;<br />
Nor equal his in hoarded heaps of grain.<br />
Obliquely in his groin, the missive spear<br />
Stuck deep,&mdash;a mortal spot: his Bactrian foe<br />
His rolling eyes beheld, and dying breath<br />
In sobs convulsive flitting, and exclaim'd;&mdash;<br />
“This spot thou pressest, now of all thy lands,<br />
“Possess,”&mdash;and turning left the lifeless corse.<br />
Avenging Perseus hurls at him the spear,<br />
Torn from the smoking wound; the point, receiv'd<br />
Full in the nostrils, pierces through the neck:<br />
Before, behind, expos'd the weapon stands.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now fortune aids his blows, the brother pair,<br />
Clanis, and Clytius fall, by different wounds.<br />
Hurl'd by his nervous arm, the ashen spear<br />
Transfix'd the thighs of Clytius: Clanis dy'd<br />
Biting the steel that pierc'd his mouth. Now fell<br />
Mendesian Celadon; and Astreus borne<br />
By Hebrew mother, to a doubtful sire.<br />
Now dy'd Ethion, once deep skill'd to see<br />
The future fates; now by his skill deceiv'd.<br />
Thoactes, who the monarch's armor bore;<br />
And base Agyrtes, murderer of his sire.<br />
Crowds though he conquers, thickening crowds remain;<br />
<a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;177]</span>
For all united wage on him the war.<br />
In every quarter fight the press, conspir'd<br />
To aid a cause to worth and faith oppos'd.<br />
The sire, with useless piety,&mdash;the queen,<br />
And new-made bride, the hero's party take;<br />
And fill the hall with screams. The clang of arms,<br />
And groans of dying men their screamings drown.<br />
The houshold deities, polluted once,<br />
The fierce Bellona bathes with gore again;<br />
With double fury lighting up the war.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Phineus, followed by a furious throng<br />
Surrounds him single; thicker fly their darts<br />
Than wintry hail, on every side; his sight<br />
They cloud, and deafening, whiz his ears around.<br />
By crowds opprest, retreating, Perseus leans<br />
His shoulders 'gainst a massive pillar's height;<br />
And, safe behind, dares all the furious fight.<br />
Chaonian Molpeus rushes on his left;<br />
Ethemon, Nabathæan, on his right:<br />
Thus a fierce tiger, urg'd by famine, hears<br />
Combin'd the lowings of two different herds,<br />
Far distant in the vale; in doubt he stands,<br />
On this, or that to rush; and furious burns<br />
On both at once to thunder. Perseus so,<br />
To left and right inclin'd at once to bear,<br />
Plerc'd first the thigh of Molpeus,&mdash;straight he fled<br />
<a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;178]</span>
Unfollow'd; for Ethemon fiercely press'd.<br />
He, furious aiming at the hero's neck,<br />
With ill-directed strength, his weapon broke<br />
Against a column;&mdash;back the shiver'd point<br />
Sprung, and his throat transfix'd: slight was the wound;<br />
To doom to death unable. Perseus plung'd<br />
His mortal falchion, as the trembling wretch<br />
His helpless arms extended, in his breast.<br />
But now his valor Perseus found oppress'd<br />
By crowds unequal, and aloud exclaim'd;&mdash;<br />
“Since thus you force me, from my very foe<br />
“More aid I'll ask;&mdash;my friends avert your eyes!”<br />
Then shew'd the Gorgon's head. “Go, elsewhere seek,”<br />
Said Thescelus,&mdash;“for those such sights may move:”&mdash;<br />
The deadly javelin poising in his hand,<br />
In act to throw, a marble form he stands,<br />
In the same posture. Near him Ampyx rear'd,<br />
Against the brave Lyncides' breast his sword;<br />
His uprais'd hand was harden'd; here, or there,<br />
To wave unable. Nileus now display'd<br />
Seven argent streams upon a shield of gold;<br />
False boasting offspring from the seven-mouth'd Nile;<br />
And cry'd;&mdash;“Lo! Perseus, whence my race deriv'd;<br />
“Down to the silent shades this solace bear<br />
“By such a hand to die.” The final words<br />
Were lost; his sounding voice abrupt was stay'd;<br />
His open'd mouth still seem'd the words to form,<br />
<a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;179]</span>
Incapable to utter. Eryx storm'd<br />
At these, exclaiming;&mdash;-“not the Gorgon's hairs<br />
“Freeze ye, but your own trembling, dastard souls:<br />
“Rush forth with me, and on the earth lay low,<br />
“The youth who battles thus with magic arms.”<br />
Fierce had he rush'd, but firmly fixt his feet<br />
Held him to earth, a rigid, fasten'd stone;<br />
A statue arm'd. These well their fate deserv'd,<br />
But one, Aconteus, while in aid he fought<br />
Of Perseus, sudden stood to stone congeal'd;<br />
As star'd the Gorgon luckless in his face.<br />
Him saw Astyages, but thought he liv'd;<br />
And fierce attack'd him with a mighty sword.<br />
Shrill tinkling sounds the blow: astonish'd stands<br />
Astyages;&mdash;astonish'd seems the stone;<br />
For while he stares, he too to marble turns.<br />
Long were the tale, of each plebeïan death<br />
To tell; two hundred still unhurt remain;<br />
By Gorgon's head two hundred stiffen'd stand:<br />
When Phineus seems the strife unjust to mourn.<br />
But what to act remains? Around him crowd,<br />
The forms of numerous friends: his friends he knows,<br />
Their aid intreats, and calls on each by name:<br />
Still doubting, seizes those his grasp can reach<br />
And finds them stone! Averse he turns his eyes;<br />
Raises his conscious arms and hands oblique,<br />
And suppliant begs;&mdash;“go Perseus,&mdash;conqueror, go!<br />
<a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;180]</span>
“Remove that dreadful monster,&mdash;bear away<br />
“That stone-creating visage, Gorgon's head!<br />
“Whate'er it be, I pray thee bear it hence.<br />
“Nor hate, nor lust of empire, rais'd our arms<br />
“Against thee;&mdash;for my wife alone we warr'd.<br />
“Thy cause, by merit best; mine, but by time.<br />
“Bravest of men, me much it grieves I e'er,<br />
“Thy claim oppos'd: existence only give,<br />
“All else be thine.” To him, as thus he begg'd,<br />
Fearing his eyes, to whom he suppliant spoke<br />
To turn;&mdash;“thou dastard, Phineus!” Perseus cry'd,&mdash;<br />
“What I can grant, I will; and what I grant<br />
“To souls like thine a mighty boon must seem.<br />
“Dispel thy terror; rest from steel secure.<br />
“Yet must a during monument remain,<br />
“Still in the dwelling of my spouse's sire,<br />
“Conspicuous. So my bride may daily see<br />
“Her imag'd husband.” Speaking thus, he held<br />
The Gorgon's head, where pallid, Phineus turn'd;<br />
So turning stiffen'd stood the neck; so turn'd<br />
Appear'd th' inverted eyes; the humid balls<br />
To stone concreted. Still the timid look,<br />
And suppliant face, and tame-petitioning arms,<br />
And guilty awe-struck look, in stone remain'd.<br />

Avenging war on Pr&oelig;tus he declares.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minerva pleas'd attention to the muse,<br />
While thus she spoke afforded; prais'd the song,<br />
And prais'd the just resentment of the maids.<br />
Then to herself;&mdash;“the vengeance others take,<br />
“Merely to praise were mean. I too should claim<br />
“Like praise, for like revenge; nor longer bear<br />
“My power contemn'd, by who unpunish'd live.”<br />
And on Arachné, fair Mæönian maid,<br />
She turns her vengeful mind; whose skill she heard<br />
Rivall'd her own in labors of the loom.<br />
No fame her natal town, no fame her sire<br />
On her bestow'd; her skill conferr'd renown.<br />
<a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;206]</span>
Idmon of Colophon, her humble sire<br />
Soak'd in the Phocian dye the spongy wool.<br />
Her mother, late deceas'd, from lowest stock,<br />
Had sprung; and wedded with an equal mate.<br />
Yet had she gain'd through all the Lydian towns<br />
For skill a mighty fame. Though born so low,<br />
Though small Hypæpe was her sole abode,<br />
Oft would the nymphs the vine-clad Tmolus leave<br />
To view her wonderous work. Oft would the nymphs<br />
In admiration quit Pactolus' waves.<br />
Nor pleasure only gave the finish'd robe,<br />
When view'd; but while she work'd she gave delight;<br />
Such comely grace in every turn appear'd.<br />
Whether she rounded into balls the wool;<br />
Or with her fingers mollify'd the fleece;<br />
And comb'd it floating light in cloudy waves;<br />
Or her smooth spindle twirl'd with agile thumb;<br />
Or with her needle painted: plain was seen<br />
Her skill from Pallas learnt. This to concede<br />
Unwilling, she ev'n such a tutor scorn'd<br />
Exclaiming:&mdash;“come let her the contest try;<br />
“If vanquish'd, let her fix my well-earn'd fate.”<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallas, an ancient matron's form conceals;<br />
Grey hairs thin strew her temples, and a staff<br />
Supports her tottering limbs; while thus she speaks:&mdash;<br />
“Old age though little priz'd, much good attends;<br />
<a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;207]</span>
“Experience always grows with lengthen'd years:<br />
“Spurn not my admonition. Great thy fame,<br />
“Midst mortals, for the wonders of the loom.<br />
“Great may it be, but to immortals yield:<br />
“Bold nymph retract, and pardon for thy words,<br />
“With suppliant voice require; Pallas will grant.”<br />
Sternly the damsel views her; quits the threads<br />
Unfinish'd; scarce her hand from force restrains:<br />
And rage in all her features flushing fierce,<br />
Thus to the goddess, well-disguis'd, she speaks:&mdash;<br />
“Weak dotard, spent with too great gift of years,<br />
“Curst with too long existence, hence, begone!<br />
“Such admonition to thy daughters give,<br />
“If daughters hast thou; or thy sons have wives:<br />
“Enough for me my inbred wisdom serves.<br />
“Hope not, that ought thy vain advice has sway'd<br />
“My purpose; still my challenge holds the same.<br />
“Why comes your goddess not? why shuns she still<br />
“The trying contest?” Then the goddess,&mdash;“Lo!<br />
“She comes,”&mdash;and flung her aged form aside,<br />
Minerva's form displaying. Every nymph,<br />
And every dame Mygdonian, lowly bent<br />
In veneration. While Arachné sole<br />
Stood stedfast, unalarm'd; but yet she blush'd.<br />
A sudden flush her angry face deep ting'd,<br />
But sudden faded pale. A ruddy glow<br />
Thus teints the early sky, when first the morn<br />
<a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;208]</span>
Arises; quickly from the solar ray<br />
Paling to brightness. On her purpos'd boast<br />
Still stubborn bent, she obstinately courts<br />
Her sure destruction, for the empty hope<br />
Of conquest in the strife so madly urg'd.<br />
No more Jove's maid refuses, gives no more<br />
Her empty admonitions, nor delays<br />
The contest: each her station straight assumes,<br />
Tighten each web; each slender thread prepare.<br />
Firm to the beam the cloth is fix'd; the reed<br />
The warp divides, with pointed shuttle, swift<br />
Gliding between; which quick their fingers throw,<br />
Quick extricate, and with the toothy comb<br />
Firm press'd between the warp, the threads unite.<br />
Both hasten now; their garments round them girt,<br />
Their skilful hands they ply: their toil forgot<br />
In anxious wish for conquest. There appear'd,<br />
The wool of Tyrian dye, and softening teints<br />
Lost imperceptible. So seems the arch<br />
Coloring a spacious portion of the sky;<br />
Struck by the rays of Ph&oelig;bus, when the showers<br />
Recede, a thousand varying tinges shine;<br />
The soft transition mocks the straining eye,<br />
So like the shades which join, though far distinct<br />
Their distant teints. In slender threads they twist<br />
The pliant gold, and in the web display,<br />
Each as she works, an ancient story fair.<br />
<a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;209]</span>
Minerva paints the rock of Mars so fam'd<br />
In Cecrops' city, and the well-known strife<br />
To name the town. Twice six celestials sate<br />
On their high thrones, great Jupiter around<br />
In gravity majestic; every god<br />
Bore his celestial features. Jove appear'd<br />
In royal dignity. The Ocean power<br />
Standing she pictur'd, with his trident huge<br />
Smiting the rugged rock; from the cleft stone<br />
Leap'd forth a steed; and thence the town to name<br />
The privilege he claim'd. Herself she paints<br />
Shielded, and arm'd with keenly-pointed spear.<br />
Helm'd was her head; her breast the Ægis bore.<br />
Struck by her spear, the earth a hoary tree<br />
She shews producing, loaded thick with fruit.<br />
The wondering gods the gift admire; the prize<br />
To her awarded, ends the glorious work.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More, that the daring rival of her art,<br />
Should learn experimental, what reward<br />
Her mad attempt might hope, four parts she adds;<br />
And every part a test of power presents:<br />
Bright the small figures in her colors shine.<br />
This angle Thracian Rhodopé contains,<br />
With Hæmus; both their mortal bodies now,<br />
To frozen mountains chang'd; whose lofty pride<br />
<a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;210]</span>
Assum'd the titles of celestial powers.<br />
Another corner held the wretched fate<br />
Felt by Pygmæa's matron; Juno bade<br />
Her vanquish'd rival soar aloft a crane;<br />
And on her people wage continual war.<br />
Antigoné, she paints;&mdash;audacious she<br />
With Jove's imperial consort durst contend;<br />
By Jove's imperial queen she flits a bird:<br />
Nor aids her Ilium ought; nor aids her sire,<br />
Laömedon;&mdash;upborne on snowy wings,<br />
A stork she rises; loud with chattering bill<br />
She noises. In the sole remaining part,<br />
Was childless Cynaras, in close embrace,<br />
Grasping the temple's steps, his daughters once;<br />
And as he lies extended on the stone,<br />
In marble seems to weep. Around the piece<br />
She spreads the peaceful olive: all complete<br />
Her work is ended with her favorite tree.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arachné paints Europa, by a bull<br />
Deceiv'd; the god a real bull appears;<br />
And real seem the waves. She, backward turn'd,<br />
Views the receding shore, and seems to shriek<br />
Loud to her lost companions; seems to dread<br />
The dashing waves, and timid shrinks her feet.<br />
She draws Asteria, by the god o'er-power'd,<br />
Cloth'd in an eagle. Leda, fair she lays<br />
<a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;211]</span>
Beneath his wings, when he a swan appears.<br />
She adds how Jove beneath a Satyr's shape<br />
Conceal'd, the beauteous child of Nycteus fill'd,<br />
With a twin-offspring. In Amphytrion's form<br />
Alcmena, thou wert press'd. A golden shower<br />
Danaë deceiv'd. A flame Ægina caught.<br />
A shepherd's shape Mnemosyné beguil'd.<br />
And fair Deöis trusts a speckled snake.<br />
Thee, Neptune, too she painted, for the maid<br />
Æolian, to a threatening bull transform'd.<br />
Thou, as Enipeus, didst the Aloïd twins<br />
Beget. Beneath the semblance of a ram,<br />
Theophané was cheated. Ceres mild,<br />
Of grain inventress, with her yellow locks,<br />
In shape a courser felt thy ardent love.<br />
Medusa, mother of the flying steed,<br />
Nymph of the snaky tresses, in a bird<br />
Conceal'd, you forc'd. Melantho in a fish.<br />
To these the damsel, all well-suiting forms<br />
Dispens'd, and all well-suiting scenes attend.<br />
And there Apollo in a herdsman's guise<br />
Wanders. And now he soars a plumy hawk:<br />
Now stalks a lordly lion. As a swain<br />
Macarean Isse, felt his amorous guile,<br />
Erigoné to Bacchus' flame was dup'd<br />
Beneath a well-seem'd grape. Saturn produc'd<br />
The Centaur doubly-shap'd, in form a steed.<br />
<a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;212]</span>
Her web's extremes a slender border girt,<br />
Where flowery wreathes, and twining ivy blend.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Pallas,&mdash;not even envy's rankling soul<br />
Could blame the work. The bright immortal griev'd<br />
To view her rival's merit, angry tore<br />
The picture glowing with celestial crimes.<br />
A boxen shuttle, grasping in her hand,<br />
Thrice on the forehead of th' Idmonian maid<br />
She struck. No more Arachné, hapless bore,<br />
But twisted round her neck with desperate pride<br />
A cord. The deed Minerva pitying saw<br />
And check'd her rash suspension.&mdash;“Impious wretch!<br />
“Still live,” she cry'd, “but still suspended hang;<br />
“Curs'd to futurity, for all thy race,<br />
“Thy sons and grandsons, to the latest day<br />
“Alike shall feel the sentence.” Speaking thus,<br />
The juice of Hecat's baleful plant she throws:<br />
Instant besprinkled by the noxious drops,<br />
Her tresses fall; her nose and ears are lost;<br />
Her body shrinks; her head is lessen'd more;<br />
Her slender fingers root within her sides,<br />
Serving as legs; her belly forms the rest;<br />
From whence her thread she still derives and spins:<br />
Her art pursuing in the spider's shape.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Lydia rung; the wonderous rumor spread<br />
<a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;213]</span>
Through every Phrygian town; the tale employ'd<br />
The tongues of all mankind. The nymph was known,<br />
Ere yet Amphion's nuptial bed she press'd,<br />
To Niobé. She, when a virgin dwelt<br />
In Lydian Sipylus. She still unmov'd,<br />
Arachné's neighboring fate not heeded, still<br />
Proudly refus'd before the gods to bend;<br />
And spoke in haughty boasting. Much her pride<br />
By favoring gifts was swol'n. Not the fine skill<br />
Amphion practis'd; not the lofty birth<br />
Each claim'd; not all their mighty kingdom's power,<br />
So rais'd her soul (of all though justly proud)<br />
As her bright offspring. Justly were she call'd<br />
Most blest of mothers; but her bliss too great<br />
Seem'd to herself, and caus'd a dread reverse.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Manto, sprung from old Tiresias, skill'd<br />
In future fate, impell'd by power divine,<br />
In every street with wild prophetic tongue<br />
Exclaim'd;&mdash;“Ye Theban matrons, haste in crowds,<br />
“Your incense offer, and your pious prayers,<br />
“To great Latona, and the heavenly twins,<br />
“Latona's offspring; all your temples bound<br />

Comes Niobé, in gorgeous Phrygian robe,<br />
Inwrought with gold, attir'd. Beauteous her form,<br />
Beauteous, as rage permitted. Angry shook<br />
Her graceful head; and angry shook the locks<br />
That o'er each shoulder wav'd. Proudly she tower'd.<br />
Her haughty eyes, round from her lofty stand<br />
Wide darting, cry'd;&mdash;“What madness this to place<br />
“Reported gods above the gods you see!<br />
“Why to Latona's altars bend ye low,<br />
“Nor incense burn before my power divine?<br />
“My sire, was Tantalus: of mortals sole,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside the garlands thrown, and incomplete,<br />
The rites relinquish'd, what the Thebans could<br />
They gave: their whispering prayers the matron dame<br />
Address'd. With ire the angry goddess flam'd,<br />
And thus on Cynthus' lofty top bespoke<br />
Her double offspring:&mdash;“O, my children! see,<br />
“Your parent, proud your parent to be call'd,&mdash;<br />
“To no celestial yielding, save the queen<br />
“Of Jove supreme. Lo! doubted is my claim<br />

“To me from endless ages, driven, I go;<br />
“Save by my children succour'd. Nor this grief<br />
“Alone me irks, for Niobé me mocks!&mdash;<br />
“Her daring crime increasing, proud she sets<br />
“Her offspring far 'bove you. Me too she spurns,&mdash;<br />
“To her in number yielding; childless calls<br />
“My bed, and proves the impious stock which gave<br />
“Her tongue first utterance.” More Latona felt<br />
Prepar'd to utter; more beseechings bland<br />
For her young offspring, when Apollo, cry'd:<br />
“Enough, desist to plain;&mdash;delay is long<br />
“Till vengeance.” Dian' join'd him in his ire.<br />
Swift gliding down the sky, and veil'd in clouds,<br />
On Cadmus' roof they lighted. Wide was spread,<br />
A level plain, by constant hoofs well beat,<br />
The city's walls adjoining; crowding wheels,<br />
And coursers' feet the rolling dust upturn'd.<br />
<a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;217]</span>
Here of Amphion's offspring daily some<br />
Mount their fleet steeds; their trappings gaily press<br />
Of Tyrian dye: heavy with gold, the rens<br />
They guide. 'Mid these Ismenos, primal born<br />
Of Niobé, as round the circling course,<br />
His well-train'd steed he sped, and strenuous curb'd<br />
His foaming mouth,&mdash;loudly “Ah, me!” exclaim'd,<br />
As through his bosom deep the dart was driv'n:<br />
Dropp'd from his dying hands the slacken'd reins;<br />
Slowly, and sidelong from his courser's back<br />
He tumbled. Sipylus, gave uncheck'd scope<br />
To his, when through the empty air he heard,<br />
The rattling quiver sound: thus speeding clouds<br />
Beheld, the guider of the ruling helm,<br />
A threatening tempest fearing, looses wide<br />
His every sail to catch the lightest breeze.<br />
Loose flow'd his reins. Th' inevitable dart<br />
The flowing reins quick follow'd. Quivering shook,<br />
Fixt in his upper neck, the naked steel,<br />
Far through his throat protruding. Prone he fell<br />
O'er his high courser's head; his smoking gore,<br />
The ground defiling. Hapless Ph&oelig;dimas,<br />
And Tantalus, his grandsire's name who bore,<br />
Their 'custom'd sport laborious ended, strove<br />
With youthful vigor in the wrestling toil.<br />
Now breast to breast they strain'd with nervous grasp,<br />
When the swift arrow from the bended horn,<br />
<a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;218]</span>
Both bodies pierc'd, as close both bodies join'd;<br />
At once they groan'd; at once their limbs they threw,<br />
With agonies convuls'd, prone on the earth;<br />
At once their rolling eyes the light forsook;<br />
At once their souls were yielded forth to air.<br />
Alphenor saw, and smote his grieving breast;<br />
Flew to their pallid limbs, and as he rais'd,<br />
Their bodies, in the pious office fell:<br />
For Ph&oelig;bus drove his fate-wing'd arrow deep<br />
Through what his heart inclos'd. Sudden withdrawn,<br />
On the barb'd head the mangled lungs were stuck;<br />
And high in air his soul gush'd forth in blood.<br />
But beardless Damasichthon, by a wound<br />
Not single fell, as those; struck where the leg<br />
To form begins, and where the nervous ham<br />
A yielding joint supplies. The deadly dart<br />
To draw essaying, in his throat, full driven,<br />
Up to the feather'd head, another came:<br />
The sanguine flood expell'd it, gushing high,<br />
Cutting the distant air. With outstretcht arms<br />
Ilioneus, the last, besought in vain;<br />
Exclaiming,&mdash;“spare me, spare me, all ye gods!”<br />
Witless that all not join'd to cause his woe.<br />
The god was touch'd with pity, touch'd too late,&mdash;<br />
Already shot th' irrevocable dart:<br />
Yet light the blow was given, and mild the wound<br />

Indignant, that such power they dare to use.<br />

“Superior I 'midst all this loss remain.”<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spoke;&mdash;the twanging bowstring sounded loud!<br />
Terrific noise,&mdash;save Niobé, to all:<br />
She stood audacious, callous in her crime.<br />
<a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;220]</span>
In mourning vesture clad, with tresses loose,<br />
Around the funeral couches of the slain,<br />
The weeping sisters stood. One strives to pluck<br />
The deep-stuck arrow from her bowels,&mdash;falls,<br />
And fainting dies; her brother's clay-cold corse,<br />
Prest with her lips. Another's soothing words<br />
Her hapless parent strive to cheer,&mdash;struck dumb,<br />
She bends beneath an unseen wound; her words<br />
Reach not her parent, till her life is fled.<br />
This, vainly flying, falls: that drops in death<br />
Upon her sister's body. One to hide<br />
Attempts: another pale and trembling dies.<br />
Six now lie breathless, each by vary'd wounds;<br />
One sole remaining, whom the mother shields,<br />
Wrapt in her vest; her body o'er her flung,<br />
Exclaiming,&mdash;“leave me this, my youngest,&mdash;last,<br />
“Least of my mighty numbers,&mdash;one alone!”<br />
But while she prays, the damsel pray'd for dies.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all depriv'd, the solitary dame,<br />
Amid the lifeless bodies of her sons,<br />
Her daughters, and her spouse, by sorrows steel'd,<br />
Sits harden'd: no light gale her tresses moves;<br />
No blood her redden'd cheeks contain; her eyes<br />
Motionless glare upon her mournful face;<br />
Life quits the statue: even her tongue congeals,<br />
Within her stony palate; vital floods<br />
<a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;221]</span>
Cease in her veins to flow; her neck to bow<br />
Resists; her arms to move in graceful guise;<br />
Her feet to step; and even to stone are turn'd<br />
Her inmost bowels. Still to weep she seems.<br />
Wrapt in a furious whirlwind, distant far<br />
Her natal soil receives her. There fixt high<br />
On a hill's utmost summit, still she melts;<br />
Still does the rigid marble flow in tears.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now every Theban, male and female, all,<br />
Dread the fierce anger of the powers of heaven;<br />
And with redoubled fervor lowly bend,<br />
And own the twin-producing goddess' power.<br />
Then, as oft seen, they ancient tales recount,<br />
Reminded by events of recent date.<br />
Thus one relates.&mdash;“Long since some clowns, who till'd<br />
“The fertile fields of Lycia, felt the ire<br />
“Of this high goddess, whom they durst despise.<br />
“Obscure the fact itself, for low the race<br />
“Who suffer'd; yet most wonderous was the deed.<br />
“Myself have seen the marsh; the lake have seen<br />
“Fam'd for the prodigy. My aged sire,<br />
“To toil unable on the lengthen'd road,<br />
“Me thither sent; an herd of choicest beeves<br />
“Thence to conduct; to my unpractis'd steps<br />
“A guiding native of the land he gave.<br />
“While we the pastures travers'd, lo! we found<br />
<a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;222]</span>
“An ancient altar, 'midst a spacious lake<br />
“Erected; black with sacrificing dust;<br />
“With waving reeds surrounded. Here my guide<br />
“Halted, and softly whisper'd,&mdash;bless me, power!<br />
“And I, like softly whispering,&mdash;bless me!&mdash;cry'd.<br />
“Then ask'd, if nymph, or fawn, or native god<br />
“The altar own'd?&mdash;when thus my guide reply'd.<br />
“No mountain god, O, youth! this altar claims,<br />
“But her whom once imperial Juno's rage,<br />
“Stern interdicted from firm earth's extent:<br />
“Whom scarce the wandering Delos would receive,<br />
“Ardent beseeching, when the buoyant isle<br />
“Light floated. There at length, Latona, laid<br />
“Betwixt a palm, and bright Minerva's tree,<br />
“Spite of their fierce opposing step-dame's power,<br />
“Her twins produc'd. Even hence, in child-bed driven,<br />
“She fled from Juno; in her bosom bore,<br />
“'Tis said, the twin-celestials. Now the sun<br />
“With fervid rays, had scorch'd the arid meads,<br />
“When faint with lengthen'd toil, the goddess gain'd<br />
“The edge of Lycia's monster-breeding clime;<br />
“Parch'd and exhausted, from the solar heat,<br />
“And infants milking her exhausted breast.<br />
“By chance a lake, far distant she espy'd,<br />
“Deep in a vale's recess, of waters pure.<br />
“There clowns the bulrush gather'd; there they pluck'd<br />
“The shrubby osier, and the marsh-fond grass.<br />
<a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;223]</span>
“Approach'd the goddess; on her knees low bent,<br />
“The earth she press'd, and forward lean'd to drink<br />
“The cooling liquid. This the rustic mob<br />
“Forbade. When she to those who thus oppos'd,&mdash;<br />
“Water withhold? Water whose use is free?<br />
“Nature to all unsparing gives to take,<br />
“Of light, of air, and of the flowing stream.<br />
“I claim but public gifts: yet suppliant beg<br />
“Those public gifts to share. Not here I come,<br />
“My weary'd arms and limbs within the waves<br />
“To lave: my thirst alone I wish to slake.<br />
“Even now my speaking lips their moisture want;<br />
“Scarce my parch'd throat, a passage to my words<br />
“Can yield. As nectar were the limpid draught.<br />
“Life with the water give me; for to me,<br />
“Water is life; with water life I seek.<br />
“Let these too move you, who their tender hands<br />
“Stretch to your bosoms,&mdash;for by chance the babes<br />
“Their little hands held forth. The goddess' words,<br />
“Thus bland-beseeching, who could e'er withstand?<br />
“Yet these persisted;&mdash;obstinate refus'd<br />
“To grant her wish, and with opprobrious speech<br />
“And threats revil'd her, should she there remain.<br />
“Nor rested thus,&mdash;the lake with hands and feet<br />
“Muddy they trouble; with malicious leaps<br />
“They agitate the pool, and upward stir<br />
“From the deep bottom clouds of slimy ooze.<br />
<a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;224]</span>
“Anger her thirst diverted. Rage deny'd<br />
“More supplication from th' indignant dame.<br />
“Their threatening words, no more the goddess brook'd;<br />
“But raising high to heaven her hands, she cry'd,&mdash;<br />
“Be this your home for ever!&mdash;Gracious heard,<br />
“Her prayer was granted. Now they joy to plunge,<br />
“Beneath the waters; now they deep immerge<br />
“Their bodies in the hollow fen; now raise<br />
“Their heads, and skim the surface of the pool,<br />
“Often they rest upon the margin's brink,<br />
“And oft light-springing, in the cool lake plunge.<br />
“Now still their rude contentious tongues they use,<br />
“Still squabbling, lost to shame beneath the waves:<br />
“Beneath the waves they still abusings strive<br />
“To utter. Hoarsely still their voice is heard,<br />
“Through their wide-bloated throats. Their railing words,<br />
“Their jaws more wide dilate. Depriv'd of neck,<br />
“Their head and back in junction seem to meet;<br />
“Green shine their backs; their bellies, hugely swol'n<br />
“Are white; and frogs they plunge within the pool.”<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus as the man, the fate destructive told<br />
Of Lycia's clowns, to mind another call'd<br />
The satyr's fate, who vanquish'd in the strife<br />
Of skill, on Pallas' pipe, Latona's son<br />
Severely punish'd.&mdash;“Wherefore thus,”&mdash;he cries,<br />
“Rent from myself? O, penitent I bow.<br />
<a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;225]</span>
“The pipe,” he shrieks, “should not such rage provoke.”<br />
Exclaiming thus, o'er his extremest limbs<br />
Stript was his skin; he one continuous wound!<br />
Blood flow'd from every part; the naked nerves<br />
Bare started; and the trembling veins full throbb'd,<br />
By skin uncover'd. Every beating part<br />
Inward, the breast's translucent fibres plain<br />
Display'd to sight. Him every forest fawn;<br />
Each brother satyr; and each sylvan god;<br />
And every nymph, with fam'd Olympus wept:<br />
And every swain, the woolly flock who fed;<br />
Or on the mountain watch'd the horned herd.<br />
Wash'd by their falling tears, the fertile earth<br />
Is soak'd,&mdash;absorbs them in her inmost veins;<br />
Then form'd to water, spouts them high in air.<br />
Rapid 'twixt banks declivitous, they seek<br />
The ocean. Marsya, is the river call'd;<br />
The clearest stream through Phrygia's land which flows.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far the crowd;&mdash;and then lamenting turn<br />
To present griefs:&mdash;Amphion's race extinct,<br />
Unanimous they wail; but hated still<br />
Remains the mother's pride. For her alone<br />
Weep'd Pelops;&mdash;rent his garments, bare expos'd<br />
His breast and shoulders lay, and fair display'd<br />
The ivory joint. This shoulder at his birth<br />
In fleshy substance, and carnation tinge,<br />
<a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;226]</span>
Equall'd the right. When by his sire his limbs<br />
Disjointed lay, the gods, 'tis said, quick join'd<br />
The sever'd members: every fragment found,<br />
Save what combin'd the neck and upper arm;<br />
The part destroy'd, with ivory they replace;<br />
And Pelops perfect from the gift became.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbouring lords assemble;&mdash;every town<br />
Their kings intreat condolence to bestow,<br />
And all to Thebes repair. First Argos sends;<br />
Sparta; Mycené; Calydon, not yet<br />
By stern Diana hated; Corinth, fam'd<br />
For beauteous brass; Orchomenus the fierce;<br />
Messené fertile; Patræ; Pylos, rul'd<br />
By Neleus; Tr&oelig;zen, yet unus'd to own<br />

And all those towns the isthmus views without.<br />
Athens, incredible! was absent sole.<br />
War all her energy demanded. Borne<br />
O'er ocean, fierce barbarian troops, the walls<br />
Mopsopian threaten'd. Thracian Tereus, these<br />
With arms auxiliar routed; bright his name<br />
Shone from the conquest. Him in riches great,<br />
Mighty in power, and from the god-like Mars,<br />
His lineage tracing, Procné's nuptial hand<br />
Close to Pandion bound. Their marriage bed<br />
<a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;227]</span>
Nor Grace, nor Hymen, nor the nuptial queen<br />
Attended. Furies held the torches, snatch'd<br />
From biers funereal. Furies spread the couch:<br />
And all night long an owl, ill-omen'd bird,<br />
Perch'd on the roof that crown'd the marriage dome.<br />
Join'd with such omens, with such omens bore<br />
Procné a son to Tereus. Wide through Thrace<br />
Congratulations sound: glad thanks to heaven<br />
The parents give, and hail the happy day<br />
Which gave Pandion's daughter to the king;<br />
And gave the pair a son. So ignorant still<br />
Mankind of real happiness remain!<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now through five autumns had the cheerful sun<br />
The whirling year renew'd. When Procné, bland<br />
Her spouse besought.&mdash;“If grace within thy sight<br />
“Claim my deserts,&mdash;or suffer me to see<br />
“In her own clime my sister, or to ours<br />
“My sister bring: a quick return thou well<br />
“Our sire may'st promise. This high boon obtain'd,<br />
“My sister's presence,&mdash;to my sight thou'lt seem,<br />
“A deity in goodness.”&mdash;On the main<br />
He bids them launch the vessel; in the port<br />
Cecropian enters, urg'd by oar and sail;<br />
And treads Piræus' shore. Soon as he gain'd<br />
His audience; soon as hand with hand was clasp'd,<br />
His ill-presaging speech he open'd. First<br />
<a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;228]</span>
The journey's cause narrating; fond desire<br />
Of Procné; and the promis'd quick return<br />
Of Philomela, should the sire comply.<br />
Lo! Philomela enters, splendid robes<br />
Attire her; still more splendid shine her charms:<br />
Such they describe within the forests rove<br />
Dryad, and Naiäd nymphs; such would they seem<br />
Their shape like hers adorn'd, like hers attir'd.<br />
Instant was Tereus at the sight inflam'd;<br />
So instant would the hoary harvest burn,<br />
The torch apply'd: so burn the wither'd leaves;<br />
Or hoarded hay. Well might her charms inspire<br />
Such love in any;&mdash;him his inbred lust<br />
More goaded, more his country's warmth which burns<br />
Intense; he flames from nature, and from clime.<br />
First to corrupt th' attendants he designs,<br />
And faithful nurse; and Philomel' to tempt<br />
With gifts immense,&mdash;his kingdom's mighty price.<br />
Or forceful snatch her, and the rape defend,<br />
With all the powers of war. Nought but he dares.<br />
Impell'd by love's unbridled power; his breast<br />
The raging fire contains not. Irksome seems<br />
Delay:&mdash;and eager to the anxious wish<br />
Of Procné, turns his converse; her desires<br />
His wishes aiding. Eloquent he spoke;<br />
For love inspir'd him. Often as he press'd<br />
More close than prudent, all his earnest speech,<br />
<a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;229]</span>
Procné, he said, dictated.  Heavens! how dark<br />
The gloom that blinds the view of human souls.<br />
Tereus for tenderest piety esteem'd,<br />
More as for vice he labors: praise he gains,<br />
for every crime.  Now Philomela begs,<br />
His prayer assisting; flings her winning arms<br />
Around Pandion's neck, and suppliant sues<br />
A sight of Procné; for her woe she begs,<br />
But deems she begs delight.  Her Tereus views;&mdash;<br />
Anticipates his joys; her every kiss,<br />
Her arms around her parent's neck entwin'd,<br />
But goad his passion: fuel fresh they add;<br />
Food for his flame.  And when her sire she clasps,<br />
He longs that sire to be.  Parent, not more<br />
His impious purpose would the wretch delay!<br />
The king by both their warm beseechings won,<br />
Consents;&mdash;she joyful to her father gives<br />
Glad thanks;&mdash;and hapless, deems completely blest,<br />
Herself and sister, both most deeply curst;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Ph&oelig;bus' toil nigh spent, his coursers' feet<br />
Sweep'd down the slope of heaven. The royal feast,<br />
And golden goblets, fill'd with Bacchus' gift,<br />
The board bespread.  From hence in slumbers soft,<br />
Each sought repose.  All but the Thracian king,<br />
Though far remov'd, still burning; all her face,<br />
Her hands and gesture he recals, and paints<br />
<a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;230]</span>
At pleasure all her beauties yet unseen:<br />
Feeding his flame, and sleep repelling far.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas morn;&mdash;Pandion, pressing warm the hand<br />
Of Tereus, as they parted, while the tears<br />
Gush'd sudden, thus bespeaks his friendly care.<br />
“Dear son, to thee I give her, pious claims<br />
“Compel me: suppliant let me thee adjure<br />
“By faith, by kindred, and by all the gods,<br />
“Thy care paternal, shall protect the maid;<br />
“And the soft solace of my anxious years,<br />
“Speedy restore, for each delay is long.<br />
“Quick, Philomela, quick my child, rejoin<br />
“Thy sire, if filial duty sways thee. Much<br />
“Thy sister's absence pains me.”&mdash;Speaking thus<br />
He press'd with kisses soft, the maiden's lips,<br />
And dripping tears with each behest let fall.<br />
Their hands he asks as pledge of faith, and joins<br />
Their hands in his presented; tender begs<br />
His salutations to his daughter dear;<br />
And his young grandson. Scarce the last adieu,<br />
Chok'd with deep sighs, he breathes: his boding mind<br />

Safely on board the painted vessel plac'd,<br />
The land far left, as with their laboring oars<br />
<a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;231]</span>
The surges move;&mdash;exulting Tereus, cry'd,<br />
“Victorious,&mdash;lo! my utmost wishes borne<br />
Safe with me.“&mdash;Scarce his burning soul defers<br />
His hop'd-for joys. His eyes are never turn'd<br />
From the lov'd face. Thus Jove's protected bird<br />
Rapacious bears, with his sharp talons pierc'd,<br />
An hare defenceless to his lofty nest:<br />
No flight remains, the spoiler calmly views<br />
His prey. Now ended is their voyage, now<br />
Weary'd they quit their ship, and joyful touch<br />
Their native beach; and now the Thracian king<br />
Pandion's daughter to a lofty stall<br />
Conducts; by ancient trees the spot well screen'd.<br />
There he inclos'd the pale, the trembling maid,<br />
Of all things fearful, as with tears she press'd<br />
Her sister's face to see: his purpose dire<br />
Disclosing,&mdash;force the helpless maid o'ercame,<br />
Loudly exclaiming to her sire; and loud<br />
Her sister's help invoking, equal vain:<br />
But chief she begs celestial powers to aid.<br />
Trembling she lies; so seems a shuddering lamb<br />
Wounded, and from the hoary wolf's fierce jaws<br />
Just 'scap'd, not sure his safety yet he deems:<br />
So seems a dove, her plumes in blood deep-drench'd,<br />
With fear still shivering; still the hungry claws<br />
Dreading, that lately pierc'd her. Soon restor'd<br />
Her mental powers, while scatter'd hung the locks<br />
<a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;232]</span>
Rent in her anguish, high her arms she rais'd,<br />
Livid with blows, as those that mourn the dead;<br />
Exclaiming,&mdash;“O, barbarian! wretch supreme!<br />
“In cruelty and vice; whom not the charge<br />
“Parental, seal'd with pious tears could move;<br />
“A sister's charge entrusted: not her state,<br />
“Virgin defenceless; not the sacred vows,<br />
“Conjugal plighted. In confusion all<br />
“Commixt, by thee, adulteress here I lie,<br />
“Against my sister. Thou a double spouse,<br />

“Why, villain, not my hated life destroy?<br />
“Perfect in deeds atrocious; would my breath<br />

The fierce king's anger burns; no less his fear<br />
Than anger moves him: strongly spurr'd by each,<br />
His weapon from the pendent sheath he drew:<br />
<a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;233]</span>
Dragg'd by the hair, her limbs he forc'd to yield<br />
To fetters; twisting rough her arms behind.<br />
Glad Philomel' to him her throat presents,<br />
Death from the glittering sword expecting. Grasp'd<br />
In pincers, fierce her tongue he tore away;<br />
Griev'd, and indignant, as her father's name<br />
She strove to utter: trembling still appear'd<br />
The bloody root; trembling the tongue itself<br />
Murmur'd as on the gore-stain'd earth it lay:<br />
As leaps the serpent's sever'd tail, the tongue,<br />
Quivering in death, still to her feet advanc'd.<br />
This deed of horror done, 'tis said that oft<br />
(Incredible the fact) repeated force<br />
Upon her mangled form the wretch employ'd.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now dares he, all those acts atrocious done,<br />
Return to Procné. Eager as he comes,<br />
For Philomel' she asks. False tears and groans<br />
He gives: the hapless nymph he feigns deceas'd:<br />
His tears convince. Now from her shoulders torn,<br />
Her robes with gold bright-glittering, sable vests<br />
Her limbs enfolded. High an empty tomb<br />
She rais'd, and pious obsequies perform'd<br />
To manes pretended: for her sister's fate<br />
She mourn'd, whose fate such mourning ill deserv'd.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through twice six signs had Ph&oelig;bus journey'd on,<br />

The year completing. What, alas! remains<br />
For Philomela? Guards prevent her flight.<br />
Of stone erected, high the massive walls<br />
Circle her round. Her lips so mute, refuse<br />
The deed to blazon. Keen the sense of grief<br />
Sharpens the soul:&mdash;in misery the mind<br />
Ingenious sparkles. Skillful she extends<br />
The Thracian web, and on the snow-white threads,<br />
In purple letters, weaves the dreadful tale.<br />
Complete, a servant with expressive signs,<br />
The present to the queen she bids to bear.<br />
To Procné was it borne, witless the slave<br />
Of what he carry'd. Savage Tereus' spouse<br />
The web unfolded; read the mournful tale<br />
Her hapless sister told, and wonderous! sate<br />
In silence; grief her rising words repress'd:<br />
Indignant, chok'd, her throat refus'd to breathe,<br />
The angry accents to her plaining tongue.<br />
To weep she waits not, in turmoil confus'd,<br />
Justice and flagrance undistinguished lie;<br />
Her mind sole bent for vengeance on her spouse.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now was the time Sithonia's matrons wont,<br />
The rites triennial of the jovial god<br />
To tend. Those rites to conscious shade alone<br />
Confided. Rhodopé, the brazen sound<br />
Shrill tinkling, hears by night;&mdash;by night the queen<br />
<a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;235]</span>
The palace quits, attir'd as Bacchus' rites<br />
Demand; and weapon'd with the Bacchant arms.<br />
A vine her forehead girds; the nimble deer<br />
Clothes with his skin her sides; her shoulder bears<br />
A slender spear. Thus maddening, Procné seeks<br />
The woods in ire terrific, crowded round<br />
By all her followers: rack'd by inward pangs,<br />
The furious rant of Bacchus veils her woes.<br />
The lonely stable seen at length, she howls<br />
Aloud,&mdash;“Evoë, ho!”&mdash;and bursts the door;<br />
Drags thence her sister;&mdash;her thence dragg'd, invests <span class="rmn">I</span><br />
In Bacchanalian robes; her face inshrouds<br />
In ivy foliage; and astonish'd leads<br />
The trembling damsel o'er the palace steps.<br />
The horrid dome when Philomela saw,<br />
Perforce she enter'd; through her frame she shook;<br />
The blood her face deserted. Procné sought<br />
A spot retir'd, and from her features flung<br />
The sacred trappings, and her sister's face,<br />
Sorrowing and blushing, to the light unveil'd;<br />
Then ran to clasp her. She the sight not bore;<br />
Her eyes she rais'd not; her dejected brows<br />
Bent to the ground; thus by her sister seen,<br />
Encroacher on her bed. Her hands still spoke,<br />
When oaths she wish'd to utter, and to call<br />
Th' attesting gods, her foul disgrace by force<br />
To prove accomplish'd. Furious, Procné burns,<br />
<a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;236]</span>
Nor curbs her ire; her sister's streaming tears<br />
Reproving checks, and cries;&mdash;“no period now<br />
“For tears, we ask the sword! But if than sword<br />
“Vengeance more keen thou hop'st for, sister dear,<br />
“Behold me for most horrid deeds prepar'd.<br />
“Shall I with flaming torches blaze on high<br />
“His hall imperial, and the villain king<br />
“Heave in the conflagration? Shall I rend<br />

“Or this, or instant send his guilty soul<br />
“Thro' thousand wounds to judgment? What thou speak'st<br />
“Be mighty. I for mightiest acts prepare.<br />
“To fix I hesitate.” As Procné speaks,<br />
Lo! infant Itys to his mother runs;<br />
His sight her mind determines; cruel turn<br />
Her eyes, exclaiming;&mdash;“See, how like his sire's<br />
“Appear his features!”&mdash;More she spoke not, fixt<br />
Was straight her dread resolve: now fiercer burn'd<br />
Within her smother'd rage;&mdash;yet when the boy<br />
Approach'd, and round her neck his infant arms<br />
Threw, and his kisses printed on her lips,<br />
With bland caresses mingled, even the soul<br />
Of Procné melted. Mollify'd her rage,<br />
Tears hard constrain'd flow'd from unwilling eyes.<br />
Soon as the mother's feelings softening seem<br />
To melt in extreme fondness; Procné quits<br />

The sight, and to her sister's face reverts<br />
Again her visage; then on each in turn<br />
Full bent her view, she cries;&mdash;“Must one me melt<br />
“With blandish'd soothings? Must the other mute,<br />
“With tongue dismember'd stand? Must he exclaim<br />
“O, mother!&mdash;she, O, sister! never more?<br />
“To what a spouse, Pandion's daughter, see<br />
“Art thou, degenerate wife, conjoin'd! Thy sin<br />
“A spouse like Tereus to have us'd too well.”<br />
More she delays not, infant Itys drags,<br />
Swift as the Indian tiger sweeps the fawn<br />
Through shady forests. Then the lofty dome,<br />
For rooms remote well search'd, in one arrives,<br />
Where she the infant pierces; 'twixt the breast<br />
And side the weapon enters, while his hands,<br />
Suppliant, his fate foreseeing, he extends,<br />
And,&mdash;“mother! O, my mother!”&mdash;loudly cries.<br />
Nor mov'd her countenance fell;&mdash;the single wound<br />
Was deadly. Philomela, with her steel<br />
The throat divided, and the quivering limbs<br />
Dissever'd, whilst of animation still<br />
Some glimmering sparks remain'd. Of these, they part<br />
In brazen cauldrons boil: part on the spit<br />
Crackling they turn: with gore the secret rooms<br />
Offensive float. Her unsuspecting spouse<br />
Procné to feast invites; delusive feigns<br />
Her country's customs,&mdash;where 'twas given, but one<br />
<a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;238]</span>
The husband should be nigh; all menial slaves<br />
Far distant. On his ancestorial seat<br />
High-lifted, Tereus sate, and feasted there:<br />
And in his bowels deep he there entomb'd<br />
Bowels his own. So blind are human souls,&mdash;<br />
“Call Itys to the feast,”&mdash;he cries. No more<br />
Could Procné veil her savage joy;&mdash;full bent<br />
The slaughter to announce, she loud proclaim'd<br />
“Thou seek'st who with thee rests!”&mdash;Around he looks.<br />
Wondering where rests he. Philomela rush'd,<br />
Her tresses sprinkled with the ireful blood,<br />
As griev'd he, Itys calling loud, and flung,<br />
With savage fury Itys' gory head<br />
Full in his father's face; nor ever mourn'd<br />
Lost speech so much; her well-earn'd joy to show,<br />
More griev'd lost power. With outcry loud the king<br />
O'er-turn'd the table; from the Stygian vale,<br />
Invok'd the viper'd sisters: hard he strove<br />
To tear his bosom, and from thence disgorge<br />
The dire repast, the half-digested mass<br />
Of Itys' limbs. Now weeping, wild he mourns,<br />
Himself his offspring's tomb. Now fierce pursues<br />
Pandion's daughters with his unsheath'd sword.<br />
From him escaping, on light wings upborne<br />
Th' Athenians seem'd; light wings their limbs upbore!<br />
One sheltering in the woods: protecting roofs<br />
The other seeking; still the murderous deed,<br />
<a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;239]</span>
Mark'd on her breast remains; still on her plumes<br />
The teint of blood is seen. Rapid in rage<br />
And hope of vengeance, Tereus too is chang'd,<br />
And flits a bird; a plumy crest he bears,<br />
High on his head: the lengthen'd sword he bore,<br />
A beak enormous grows. A lapwing now<br />

Pandion, when the mournful tale he heard,<br />
The Stygian shades, ere yet the lengthen'd date<br />
Of years commanded. Next th' Athenian realm<br />
Erechtheus rul'd, the sceptre dubious held<br />
By right or forceful arms. Proud could he boast<br />
Four sons;&mdash;and daughters four to him were given.<br />
Beauteous the maids; in beauty equal two:<br />
Of these Æölian Cephalus was bless'd<br />
With thee as spouse, O, Procris!&mdash;Tereus long,<br />
Boreas withstanding, with the power of Thrace,<br />
Long Orithyïa, by the god belov'd,<br />
Was lov'd in vain; while soft beseechings more<br />
And prayers, the power to strenuous force preferr'd.<br />
But now those soothings bland so vainly try'd,<br />
Fierce swol'n with rage, his most accustom'd feel<br />
(Too much that passion knows this wind) he cries;&mdash;<br />
“Well I deserve it, all my proper arms<br />
“Relinquish'd: savage fierceness, strength, stern rage,<br />
<a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;240]</span>
“And threatening force. With humble softening prayers<br />
“Fool have I su'd; in each attempt have fail'd.<br />
“More apt to me is force! by force I drive<br />
“The lowering clouds before me: Ocean's waves<br />
“Forceful I turn; forceful the knotted oak<br />
“Root from its deep foundation; hard the frost<br />
“I bind; and beat the sounding earth with hail:<br />
“I when in open sky, for there our field<br />
“Lies in display, my blustering brethren meet,<br />
“Oppose such might, that midmost sky resounds<br />
“Echoing our forceful conflict; flashing flames<br />
“From the cleft bodies of the hollow clouds,<br />
“Elicited: I too, earth's secret womb<br />
“Fierce entering, in her deepest caverns strain<br />
“My strength, 'till trembling wide through all her frame,<br />
“The ghosts below are troubled. These the aid<br />
“My nuptial wish should seek; no longer pray<br />
“Erechtheus for my sire;&mdash;my sire by force,<br />
“The monarch shall be made.”&mdash;So spoke the god,<br />
Or thus, or more in fury, as he shook<br />
His plumes, whose motion sweep'd through earth's extent,<br />
And made the wide main tremble. Lofty hills<br />
His dusty mantle covers; as the plains<br />
Rapid he brushes; shrouded deep in mist,<br />
In his dark wings the furious lover clasps<br />
His Orithyïa, trembling, pale with fear:<br />
Flying his flames were fann'd, and fiercer blaz'd.<br />
<a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;241]</span>
Nor check'd the ravisher his lofty flight,<br />
Till seen the town of Cicones, whose walls<br />
Receiv'd him. There th' Athenian nymph became<br />
The freezing monarch's bride: a mother there,<br />
A double birth she brought, whose shoulders bear<br />
The father's pinions; all their semblance else<br />
Their mother's. Not at first, 'tis said, appear'd<br />
The feathers: Calaïs and Zethes, boys<br />
Were yet unplum'd; when yet with ruddy hair,<br />
Their beards appear'd not. From each shoulder shot<br />
The feathers bird-like, at the self-same time,<br />
Their manly cheeks were thick with yellow down.<br />
Now when their youth matur'd to man appear'd,<br />
Through seas unplough'd before, they sought the fleece<br />
Splendid with glittering wool; with all the train<br />
Of Minyæ, in the first-built vessel borne.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the Pagasæan vessel borne,<br />
Plough'd the wide sea the Argonauts, and saw<br />
The fate of Phineus; whose old age the curse<br />
Of hunger felt, and felt perpetual night.<br />
The youths from Boreas sprung, quick sped to flight<br />
The virgin-featur'd birds, his hapless face,<br />
Far distant. 'Neath great Jason's rule much toil<br />
They bore ere on the oozy banks they stay'd<br />
Of rapid Phasis. Here the king they seek;<br />
And here demand the golden fleece; and here<br />
An answer big with fearful labors learn<br />
The Grecian crew. Meantime the royal maid<br />
<a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;246]</span>
Burns with fierce fires: with reason struggling long,<br />
Still her hot flame to quench unable, cries<br />
Aloud Medea;&mdash;“vainly I oppose!<br />
“Some unknown god controls. Perhaps 'tis love!<br />
“If love 'tis not, no sentiment more near<br />
“To love can come. Why else my sire's commands<br />
“So harsh appear? But harsh in truth they are.<br />
“But why his failing dread? Why dread his death,<br />

“Before unknown, unwilling drags; this love<br />
“Persuades, oppos'd to reason: plain I see<br />

“If this I suffer, from the tiger sprung<br />
“Believe me; steel and marble in my breast,<br />

“Why not mine eyes with the dread sight pollute!<br />
“Why not the bulls, the earth-born foes incite,<br />
“And sleepless dragon, with redoubled ire?<br />
“Heaven wills it better. But let deeds, not prayers<br />
“My time employ. How! shall I then betray<br />
“My parent's realm? an unknown stranger aid<br />

“The sin avoid.”&mdash;She said, and duty, shame,<br />
And rectitude, before her eyes appear'd;<br />
And vanquish'd love address'd his wings to flight.<br />
Now to an ancient altar Hecat' own'd,<br />
By shady trees dark veil'd from day, she came:<br />
Her flames abated, and her eager pulse<br />
Subsided. Here Æsonides she saw,<br />
And bright her love reblaz'd. Warm flush'd her cheeks,<br />
Deep all her visage glow'd. The smallest spark<br />
Thus low in embers hid, its vigor shews;<br />
Help'd by the feeding blast, increasing burns,<br />
And stirr'd in all its wonted fury glows.<br />
Just so the languid passion which but now<br />
All but extinct appear'd, the hero seen<br />
Fresh at his beauteous presence flam'd. By chance<br />
More beauteous Jason on that morn appear'd;<br />
Well might a lover all her love excuse.<br />
She looks, his countenance with her eyes devours<br />
As then first seen; and madly fond, she deems<br />
His features more than mortal: bashful turn'd<br />
Her forehead not from his. But when her guest<br />
Address'd her: when he gently took her hands;<br />
And crav'd assistance in an humble tone,<br />
The nuptial promise giving. Plenteous flow'd<br />
Her tears, exclaiming;&mdash;“What I should perform<br />
“Plainly I see: not ignorance me misleads<br />
“But love. My gifts shall aid you, you but keep<br />
<a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;250]</span>
“The promise pledg'd.”&mdash;Sacred the hero swears<br />
By her, the tri-form'd goddess, whom that grove<br />
Acknowledges divine; and by the god,<br />
Whence sprung the sire-in-law he hopes to claim;<br />
The god who all beholds; by all his deeds<br />
Atchiev'd; and by his perils all he swears.<br />
His words believ'd, immediate he receives<br />
The magic plants, their use well taught, and seeks<br />
The roof rejoicing. Now the morn had driven<br />
The glimmering stars far distant, crowding press'd<br />
The people in the sacred field of Mars,<br />
The king himself amidst them, seated high,<br />
In purple clad, with ivory sceptre grac'd.<br />
Lo! come the brazen-footed bulls, who breathe<br />
Through nostrils fenc'd with adamant hot flames:<br />
Parch'd by their breath, the herbage blacken'd burns.<br />
Loud as the blazing forge's chimney roars;<br />
Or loud as lime in earthy furnace laid,<br />
Bursts into heat by watery sprinklings touch'd:<br />
So loud, within their flaming chests contain'd,<br />
The struggling fires loud bellow'd. Scorch'd their throats<br />
The sound transmitted. Boldly Æson's son<br />
March'd onward; fiercely as the youth approach'd,<br />
His foes dark lower'd, and bent their steel-tipt horns,<br />
Paw'd with their clefted hoofs the dusty ground,<br />
And fill'd with smoky bellowings all the air.<br />
Pale grew each Grecian face; advancing on<br />
<a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;251]</span>
The fiery blasts he feels not, such the power<br />
The mighty charms possess, but boldly strokes<br />
Their dewlaps pendulous, and to the yoke<br />
Subjected, makes them drag the ponderous plough;<br />
And with the iron cut th' uncustom'd soil.<br />
The Colchians wondering gaze; the Grecians loud<br />
Applaud, and with fresh courage fill his soul.<br />
Then from his brazen helmet pluck'd, he sows<br />
The serpent's teeth, deep in the furrow'd ground:<br />
The ground, the teeth with powerful venom ting'd,<br />
Soften'd and swell'd them, and a novel shape<br />
Imparted. Thus within the parent's womb,<br />
An human shape the infant mass receives,<br />
Completed perfect in the dark recess;<br />
Nor till mature, to air external given.<br />
So when the manly forms were perfect made<br />
Within earth's pregnant bowels, up they sprung<br />
Thick in the fruitful field; more wonderous still<br />
Their arms they clash'd when born. Then when the Greeks<br />
Their keenly-pointed spears preparing saw<br />
To hurl at Jason's head, low sunk their souls,<br />
And pallid grew their cheeks; Medea ev'n,<br />
Whose art insur'd his safety, trembling fear'd,<br />
When single she the youth beheld assail'd<br />
By foes in hosts; bloodless her face became,<br />
And tremor seiz'd her limbs: then lest the herbs<br />
<a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;252]</span>
Presented first, should fail in power, she sings<br />
An helping magic song, and all her arts<br />
Latent, calls forth. Amidst the hostile crowd<br />
A mighty rock he flings; their martial rage<br />
From him diverted, on each other turns.<br />
By mutual wounds the earth-born brothers fall;<br />
In civil discord perish. Joy'd again<br />
The Grecians clasp the conqueror in their arms.<br />
Thou too, Medea, wish'd thine arms to fill<br />
With him victorious. (Shame at first repress'd<br />
Thy open fondness, though thou wast embrac'd)<br />
Now reputation awes thee, now prevents<br />
That bliss. What honor gives,&mdash;silent to joy,<br />
And pour glad thanks to all thy magic arts,<br />
And gods their authors, those thou dar'st indulge.<br />
Now sole remains by powerful herbs to lull<br />
The wakeful dragon, whose high-crested head<br />
A triple tongue contains, whose crooked fangs<br />
Dreadful the golden fleece protecting guards.<br />
Him when be sprinkled with the juices prest<br />
From plants Lethean; and repeated thrice,<br />
The words which placid sleep inspire; which still<br />
The ruffled ocean; and arrest the course<br />
Of rapid torrents; sleep before unknown<br />
Stole o'er his eyelids, and th' Æsonian youth<br />
Seiz'd on the golden prize. Proud with the spoil,<br />
<a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;253]</span>
(A second spoil possessing) she who gave<br />
The power to conquer, as his wife he bears,<br />
And lands triumphant on Thessalia's shores.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mothers of Thessaly, and aged sires<br />
For sons restor'd, glad offerings bring: bright flames<br />
The high-heap'd incense; votive victims deck'd<br />
With gilded horns are slain: but Æson, far<br />
The grateful crowd avoids, now near his fate,<br />
Bent by a weight of years. Hence Jason spoke;&mdash;<br />
“O, spouse! to thee my life and safety ow'd;<br />
“To me, thou all hast given; the high swol'n sum<br />
“Of all thy favors might belief surpass:<br />
“This more attempt, if this thou can'st,&mdash;and what<br />
“Thy magic power defies? My years curtail,<br />
“And to my sire's existence add the term.”<br />
Fast flow'd his tears while speaking;&mdash;while he spoke,<br />
His pious duty mov'd Medea; quick<br />
Her sire Æëta, so deserted, sprung<br />
To thought, and shew'd the two contrasting souls.<br />
But, veil'd her secret thoughts, she thus replies;&mdash;<br />
“What impious accents hear I from thy tongue,<br />
“O, spouse religious? Can I then transfer<br />
“Of thy existence part? Not Hecat's power<br />
“Fateful, would sanction this; nor stands thy wish<br />
“In equity. Yet, Jason, will I try<br />
“More than thou seek'st to give. With all my skill<br />
<a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;254]</span>
“Thy sire's existence to prolong, thy years<br />
“Unshorten'd; should the tri-form'd goddess aid<br />
“Propitious my designs.”&mdash;Three nights were now<br />
Deficient, ere the full-form'd horns could meet<br />
The lunar orb to fill. Complete her round;<br />
A solid sphere of light from earth beheld,<br />
Medea wanders forth; loose all her robes;<br />
Naked her feet; bare-headed; while her hair<br />
Wild o'er her shoulders floats; and thus array'd,<br />
Untended, while deep midnight silence reigns<br />
She bends her devious way. Men, beasts, and birds,<br />
In bonds of sleep were chain'd; the hedges still,<br />
No murmur breath'd; nor wav'd the silent trees;<br />
Hush'd was the humid sky; the stars alone<br />
Twinkled: to them her arms extending, thrice<br />
She turn'd around; thrice from the flowing stream<br />
Her tresses sprinkled; thrice with yelling noise<br />
The silence broke; then with her bended knee<br />
The hard earth pressing, cry'd;&mdash;“O, night! thou friend<br />
“Of secret deeds; ye glittering stars! whose rays<br />
“With Luna's, Sol's diurnal light succeed;<br />
“And thou, O, Hecat'! tripleform'd, who know'st<br />
“My undertaking, and approaching aid'st<br />
“With incantations, and with magic powers:<br />
“And thou, O, earth! whose bosom witching plants<br />
“Affords: ye winds; ye skies; ye mountains; lakes;<br />

“Clouds form, or clouds dispel; raise furious blasts,<br />
“Or furious blasts allay; smite with my song<br />
“The dragon's furious jaws: the living rocks<br />
“I shake;&mdash;uproot the oak; the earth upturn;<br />
“Move forests; bid the trembling mountains leap;<br />
“Loud roar the ground; and from the tombs the ghosts<br />
“Affrighted walk. Thee, Luna, too I draw<br />

“My spells once utterr'd: by my poisons charm'd,<br />
“Pallid Aurora seems. You, plants! for me,<br />
“Blunted the ardor of the flaming bulls;<br />
“Press'd with the yoke, their necks impatient bent,<br />
“And dragg'd the crooked plough. You bade the race<br />
“Snake-born, upon themselves their warring rage<br />
“To turn. In sleep the roaring dragon's eyes<br />
“You steep'd; the guard eluded, sent the prize<br />
“To glad the towns of Greece. Now have I need<br />
“Of renovating herbs, to make old age<br />
“Glow once again in all its youthful bloom.<br />
“This will you grant, for sure those stars in vain<br />
“Not sparkle; nor in vain the chariot comes<br />

“Drawn by the dragons wing'd.” The chariot comes<br />
Swift sweeping through the air. Active she mounts,<br />
Strokes the rein'd dragons' manes, and shakes the thongs.<br />
On high they soar:&mdash;Thessalian Tempé far<br />
Beneath she views; then tow'rd the chalky land<br />
Her snakes directs. On Ossa's top explores<br />
For plants, and seeks what lofty Pelion bears;<br />
Othrys, and Pindus, and Olympus huge.<br />
What please her, part she with their root updrags;<br />
Part with her crooked brazen sickle mows;<br />
Apidanus; Amphrysos, on their banks<br />
Many afforded: nor Enipeus scap'd.<br />
Peneus, and Spercheus, and the rushy shores<br />
Of Bæbé some contributed. She pluck'd<br />
In Anthedon the living grass whose power,<br />
Then Glaucus' form unchang'd, was yet unknown.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now had nine days, now had nine nights elaps'd,<br />
Borne on her dragon wings, and in her car<br />
Wandering the fields among, ere back she turn'd:<br />
Unfed her dragons, save by odorous smells;<br />
Yet had they shed their scales, with youth renew'd.<br />
Arriv'd, without the palace gate she stays,<br />
And there sole shelter'd by the sky, all touch<br />
Of man denying; altars two she rears<br />
Of turf; sacred to Hecate stood the right,<br />
To Youth the left: when these with vervain bound.<br />
<a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;257]</span>
And forest boughs, here sacrifice she makes.<br />
Hard by, two trenches scoops from out the ground;<br />
Smites with her weapon in the sable throat,<br />
A sheep presented; in the open ditch<br />
Empties the blood; then bowls of wine she pours,<br />
And bowls of smoking milk; with mystic words<br />
Invokes the powers terrestrial; begs the king<br />
Of shades, and begs his ravish'd spouse to aid,<br />
Nor of his soul the aged king defraud.<br />
These when with lengthen'd prayers, and murmurings long,<br />
Appeas'd; she bids them tow'rd the altars bring<br />
The feeble Æson; his exhausted limbs<br />
Bound in deep slumber, by her magic power,<br />
Corse-like, she lays extended on the grass.<br />
Then Jason bids, and his attendant crew,<br />
Far thence depart, nor with their view prophane<br />
Her acts mysterious. As she bids they go.<br />
Medea then the flaming altars round,<br />
In Bacchanalian guise her flowing locks,<br />
Circles; and in the ditch's blackening gore<br />
Her splinter'd torches dips; with blood imbu'd,<br />
Burns them upon her altars; thrice with fire,<br />
With sulphur thrice, and thrice with flowing streams,<br />
The sire she lustrates. Heated now in brass,<br />
Her powerful medicines bubble, high and white<br />
The swelling froth appears. There boils she all<br />
The roots in vales Æmonian dug; and seeds,<br />
<a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;258]</span>
And flowers, and juices dark: gems unto these,<br />
Sought in the distant East, she adds; and adds<br />
What on the sand the refluent ocean leaves:<br />
More still, the night-long moon collected dew<br />
She brings; the dismal screech-owl's flesh and wings;<br />
The entrails of the wolf ambiguous, wont<br />
His savage face in human guise to wear:<br />
Nor wanted there, the scaly skin which clothes<br />
Th' amphibious snake Cyniphian, long and small:<br />
The beak and head a crow nine ages bore,<br />
She adds. Now was the foreign dame prepar'd,<br />
By help of these, and nameless thousands more,<br />
The promis'd boon to give, the whole she stirs<br />
Deep from the bottom, with a bough long rent,<br />
From the mild olive. Lo! the wither'd branch,<br />
The boiling caldron stirring, sudden shoots<br />
In virid freshness! shortly leaves bud forth;<br />
And soon it bends beneath a load of fruit!<br />
Where'er the fire above the hollow brass,<br />
The bubbling foam high-rais'd, and boiling drops<br />
Sprinkled the ground,&mdash;the ground with verdure smil'd;<br />
Flowers and soft herbage sprung. Medea sees,<br />
And with her weapon ope's the senior's throat;<br />
His aged blood exhausted sees, and pours<br />
Her juices copious: part his mouth receives;<br />
And part the wound. When Æson these had drank,<br />
Their hoary whiteness lost, his beard and hair,<br />
<a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;259]</span>
An ebon tinge receiv'd; his leanness fled;<br />
His pallid ghastly face no more was seen;<br />
His hollow veins with added blood were fill'd;<br />
And all his limbs in lusty plumpness swell'd.<br />
The wondering Æson, such himself beheld,<br />
As the last forty years he ne'er had past.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacchus, from heaven survey'd the mighty change<br />
Wonderous, and hence that power was given he found;<br />
His nurses to restore to youthful years:<br />
The boon from Tethys asking, he obtain'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor cease the frauds yet of the Phasian dame:<br />
Fierce hatred 'gainst her by her spouse she feigns,<br />
And flies to Pelias' court; a suppliant there,<br />
His daughters hail her guest:&mdash;the sire bent down<br />
With age. The crafty Colchian these beguiles<br />
Soon, with her well-dissembled friendship's form.<br />
Amid her mighty benefits, she tells<br />
Æson's old age remov'd; relating all,<br />
On this she chiefly dwells. Hope sudden springs<br />
Within their virgin breasts: Pelias their sire,<br />
Such art they trust may yet revivify.<br />
That art they sue for,&mdash;highest claim'd reward<br />
To her they promise: mute at first she stands,<br />
And feigning doubt, in hesitation holds,<br />
And anxious poise their eager minds. At last,<br />
<a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;260]</span>
She says, when promising,&mdash;“That in the deed,<br />
“More faith ye may confide, a leading ram,<br />
“The oldest in your fleecy flocks, a lamb<br />
“My medicine shall transform!”&mdash;Instant was dragg'd<br />
The woolly beast, whose wreathing horns around<br />
His hollow temples curl'd; whose wither'd throat<br />
The steel Thessalian stabb'd; the scanty blood<br />
The steel scarce spotting: then th' enchantress steeps<br />
His mangled body in the caldron deep,<br />
With juices powerful: smaller grow his limbs;<br />
Shed are his horns; and vanish'd are his years;<br />
And from the caldron tender bleatings sound:<br />
Instant leaps forth to all the wondering crowd<br />
The bleating lamb, which, frisking, flies and seeks<br />
The swelling teats. With admiration struck,<br />
Now Pelias' daughters faith unshaken give;<br />
More urgent press their wish. Thrice had the sun,<br />
'Merg'd in th' Iberian sea, unyok'd his steeds;<br />
And the fourth night the glittering stars had shone;<br />
When o'er the fire, pure water from the stream,<br />
And powerless plants, the false Medea plac'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all in sleep relax'd, a death-like sleep,<br />
The monarch's limbs were stretch'd; and with their king,<br />
His guards lay dormant; so her magic words,<br />
And magic tongue had doom'd. Medea leads<br />
Across the steps the daughters; bidd'n by her,<br />
<a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;261]</span>
His couch they compass.&mdash;“Why, O, feeble souls!<br />
“Thus hesitate?”&mdash;she said,&mdash;“your swords unsheathe!<br />
“Pour out his far-spent gore, that I may fill<br />
“With youthful, vigorous blood his empty'd veins.<br />
“Your father's life, and years, are in your hands:<br />
“If sways you piety; if empty hopes<br />
“Wavering deceive you not; then well deserve,<br />
“By duty to your sire: quickly expel<br />
“With weapons his old age: let issue forth<br />
“His now congealing blood with brandish'd steel.”<br />
Exhorted thus, most pious she who feels,<br />
First impious acts;&mdash;a wicked deed performs,<br />
Lest wicked she were call'd: yet on the blow<br />
Not one would bend her sight; with eyes averse<br />
Their savage hands the unseen wounds inflict.<br />
Flowing with gore, he from the bed uprais'd<br />
His limbs; and from his posture strove half-torn<br />
To rise; and stretching forth his pallid arms<br />
'Mid all their threatening swords;&mdash;“Daughters!”&mdash;he cries,<br />
“What do ye? Why against your parent's life<br />
“Thus arm ye?”&mdash;Sink their spirits! drop their hands!<br />
His throat Medea severing, stay'd the words<br />
He more had utter'd,&mdash;and the mangled corse,<br />
Deep in the boiling brazen caldron flung.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now,&mdash;but through the air on dragon wings<br />
High borne,&mdash;their furious vengeance had not scap'd.<br />
<a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;262]</span>
O'er shady Pelion high she flew, and o'er<br />
The cave of Chiron; Othrys; and the spot<br />
For old Cerambus' strange adventure known:<br />
Upborne on wings by kindly-aiding nymphs,<br />
Here, when the solid earth th' incroaching main<br />
Wide delug'd, flying, safe Deucalion's flood<br />
He 'scap'd. Æölian Pitané to left<br />
She quits; and sees the dragon huge, to stone<br />
An image turn'd. And Ida's grove where chang'd<br />
By Bacchus' power, the steer a stag became,<br />
To screen the theft. And where beneath the sand,<br />
A little sand, Corythus' father lies;<br />
And fields which Mæra's new-heard howlings fill.<br />
Euripylus' fam'd town, where Coän dames,<br />
What time the troops of Hercules them left,<br />
With horns were crown'd: and Ph&oelig;bus' favor'd Rhodes;<br />
Jalysian Telchines, whose hateful eyes<br />
All vitiating, Jove detesting 'whelm'd<br />
Beneath his brother's waves. She passes next<br />
Carthæïa' walls in ancient Cæä's isle,<br />
Where wondering saw Alcidamas the sire,<br />
A placid dove his daughter's body bear.<br />
And Hyrié's lake she sees, and Tempé's pool<br />
Cycneiän, which the swan so sudden form'd<br />
Frequented: Phyllius there, a willing slave,<br />
Birds and fierce beasts, to his capricious boy<br />
Oft brought&mdash;e'en lions tam'd; a furious bull<br />
<a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;263]</span>
He bade him bring, a furious bull he brought;<br />
But now in choler at his craving soul,<br />
The bull refus'd, though as the last gift claim'd:<br />
Indignant, cry'd he,&mdash;“soon you'll wish him given!”&mdash;<br />
And from the high rock plung'd: all thought he fell:<br />
But form'd a swan, lightly he pois'd in air<br />
On snowy wings. Hyrié, her son thus sav'd,<br />
Knew not, by constant weeping soon dissolv'd;<br />
The lake becoming that still bears her name.<br />
Near this is Pleuron:&mdash;Ophian Combé, here<br />
Wafted on wings, her murderous sons escap'd.<br />
Thence she beholds Latona's favorite isle;<br />
Calaurea, where to birds the royal pair<br />
Were chang'd: Cyllené, on the right is plac'd<br />
Where like the savage herd, Menephron sought<br />
His mother's bed. Far hence she spies in tears<br />
Cephisus, for his nephew's fate who mourn'd,<br />
Chang'd by Apollo to a sea-calf huge;<br />
And saw Eumelus' dome, who wept his child,<br />
A bird become. At length on dragon wings,<br />
Pirenian Corinth she regain'd; where tell<br />
The ancient tales, in primal ages, men<br />
From shower-fed mushrooms sprung. Here first was flam'd<br />
In Colchian venoms fierce, the new-made bride;<br />
Then either sea in blazing spires beheld<br />
The royal dome; and with her children's gore<br />
<a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;264]</span>
Her impious sword was stain'd. Thus on herself<br />
Reveng'd; from royal Jason's wrath she fled.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne hence, her snakes Titanian reach the walls<br />
Of Pallas' city, where most just of men<br />
O, Phineus! thou, and Periphas the old,<br />
With Polyphemon's niece, as birds are seen,<br />
Soaring aloft in air on new-form'd wings.<br />
Here Ægeus' roof receiv'd her, for this deed<br />
Alone to blame: not satisfy'd as host,<br />
In marriage bonds he makes her more his own.<br />
Now Theseus comes, son to his sire unknown,<br />
Whose brave atchievements, all the two-sea'd land<br />
In peace had settled. For his death she mix'd<br />
The baneful aconite, long since from shores<br />
Of Scythia brought; which thus old tales relate,<br />
From Cerberus' venom'd jaws was first produc'd,<br />
Through a dark den, with gloomy opening, lies<br />
A path steep shelving, where Alcides dragg'd<br />
Fierce Cerberus to light, resisting strong,<br />
Glancing askaunce his eyes from day, whose rays<br />
Sparkled too bright, in adamantine chains.<br />
With rabid anger swol'n, a triple yell<br />
Fill'd all the air; he o'er the virid plain<br />
Sprinkled white foam; increasing fast this shoots;<br />
The fruitful soil fresh virulence imparts,<br />
<a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;265]</span>
And ranker grows its power: from hardest rocks<br />
It lively springs, and Aconite hence nam'd.<br />
This did old Ægeus, by his crafty spouse<br />
Deceiv'd, to Theseus, as a foe, present.<br />
Unwitting Theseus, in his hand receiv'd<br />
The cup presented; when the sire espy'd<br />
Upon his ivory-hilted sword a mark,<br />
Which prov'd his offspring; from his lips he dash'd<br />
The poison. Wrapp'd in clouds by magic rais'd,<br />
The sorceress from their furious vengeance fled.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sire, though joy'd, his son in safety found,<br />
Trembles astonish'd at the narrow 'scape;<br />
And horrid crime premeditated: burns<br />
On every altar fires;&mdash;to every god<br />
Piles costly gifts: full on the brawny neck<br />
Of oxen falls, their horns with garlands bound,<br />
The sacrificing axe. Ne'er till that day<br />
Had Athens' town, such joyous feasting seen;<br />
Nobles and commons crowd around the board,<br />
And thus, by wine inspir'd, sublime they sing.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thee, mighty Theseus! Marathon admires,<br />

Strong though his troops, and though his navy strong<br />
His utmost strength was in paternal rage;<br />

Bright Cythnos; Scyros; flat Seriphus' isle;<br />
The marble Paros; and the fort betray'd<br />
For gold, demanded by the impious nymph<br />
Sithonian: still for gold she anxious seeks<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Oliaros, and Didymæ, unite;<br />
And Gyaros, Andros, Tenos, all refuse,<br />
With Peparethos, in bright olives rich,<br />

Steering, &OElig;nopia's regions Minos sought;<br />
&OElig;nopia call'd of old, Ægina now,<br />
By Æäcus, his mother's honor'd name.<br />

So highly fam'd a prince: to meet him go<br />
First Telamon, then Peleus next in age,<br />
And Phocas third and last, Ev'n Æäcus<br />
With years opprest, steps tardy forth, and asks<br />
The visit's cause. The hundred-city'd king<br />
Deep sighs, his grief paternal all renew'd,<br />
And thus replies;&mdash;“My arms, O, king! assist<br />

Angry departs, exclaiming.&mdash;“Much your league<br />
“May cost you!”&mdash;But to threaten war more safe<br />
He deems, than wage it there, and waste his force.<br />
Still from &OElig;nopia's walls the fleet was seen,<br />
Not distant far; when sped by swelling sail,<br />
An Attic ship arriv'd; the friendly port<br />
Enter'd. On board was Cephalus who bore<br />
His country's message. Well the royal youths<br />
The hero knew, though long time past beheld;<br />
And gave the friendly hand, and welcome led<br />
To their paternal dome. The graceful chief<br />
Enters, retaining still evincing marks<br />
Of pristine beauty; in his hand he bears<br />
A branch of native olive: in the midst<br />
Senior he stands; and younger on each side,<br />
Clytus, and Butes, Pallas' sons. Complete<br />
Their friendly salutations; next the words<br />

“Of sable, disappear'd, and all their limbs<br />
“An human shape confess'd. Sleep fled mine eyes;<br />
“And fled my vision:&mdash;As by heaven not mark'd,<br />
“Complaining;&mdash;far without the hall I heard<br />
“A murmuring loud, and human seem'd the sounds,&mdash;<br />
“Though stranger to mine ears: musing if still<br />
“I slept not,&mdash;Lo! quick, Telamon approach'd,<br />
“Wide threw the doors; and cry'd,&mdash;O, sire! behold;<br />
“What hope, what faith surpasses!&mdash;Forth I come;<br />
“Such men as in my dream my fancy saw,<br />
“I see;&mdash;I know them, man by man, again:<br />
“They come, and king salute me: unto Jove<br />
“My votive thanks I pay; my city share<br />
“Amongst my subjects new; and all my lands,<br />
“(Of those who till'd them, empty.) Myrmidons,<br />
“From whence they sprung, I call them. You have seen<br />
“Their bodies,&mdash;still their habits are the same:<br />
“A frugal race as wont, patient of toil;<br />
“On gain still bent; tenacious of that gain.<br />
“These equal all, in courage and in years,<br />
“Shall follow you to battle; when the east<br />
“Which blew you here so prosperous, (for the east<br />
“Had brought him) to the southern gales shall yield.”<br />
With these and such like speeches, all the day<br />
<a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;276]</span>
They sit conversing; evening they devote<br />
To banquets; and the night to soft repose.<br />
Sol rais'd his golden head, but Eurus still<br />
Prevail'd, and bound their sails. Now Pallas' sons<br />
To Cephalus, their chief in years, repair,<br />
And to the king with Pallas' sons he goes;<br />
But still deep-wrapt in sleep the king was laid.<br />
Phocus receiv'd them at the gates; employ'd<br />
Were Telamon and Peleus, troops to chuse<br />
For the new war. Th' Athenian chief he leads<br />
Within the palace, to the fairest rooms.<br />
When all were seated, Phocus mark'd the dart<br />
The hero bore, shap'd from a wood unknown,<br />
Pointed with gold; and said, with prefac'd words:<br />
“To range the forests, and fierce beasts to slay<br />
“Is all my joy; yet long in doubt I've stood<br />
“What tree this dart has form'd; for ash too pale,<br />
“Too smooth for cornel; though from whence it comes<br />
“So ignorant, ne'er before mine eyes beheld<br />
“A fairer weapon.”&mdash;Pallas' son address'd<br />
The youth:&mdash;“The javelin's use you'll more admire<br />
“Than beauty;&mdash;thrown where'er, its mark it gains,<br />
“Unrul'd by erring chance, and bloody, back<br />
“Instant returns.”&mdash;Then Phocus curious asks<br />
More full its story, how, and whence it came,<br />
And who the author of so priz'd a gift.<br />
Him Cephalus informs, but shame denies<br />
<a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;277]</span>
To tell the whole, and what the present's price.<br />
Full to his mind his consort's loss recall'd,<br />
Tears sudden gush'd:&mdash;“O, goddess-born!&mdash;he cries,<br />
“This dart (improbable howe'er) my tears<br />
“Has often caus'd,&mdash;and long will make them flow;&mdash;<br />
“If fate long life should grant. My dear-lov'd spouse<br />
“This dart destroy'd:&mdash;O, that this fatal gift<br />
“Had still been unpossess'd! Procris, ally'd<br />
“To stol'n Orithyiä (if Orithyiä's fame<br />
“Your ears has reach'd) was as her sister fair:<br />
“Nay, match'd in form and manners, she might more<br />
“The robber tempt. Her sire Erechthens join'd<br />
“To me the maid; us love more firmly bound:<br />
“Blest was I call'd, and blest I was indeed,<br />
“And still were blest, but heaven else will'd my fate.<br />
“Now had the second month connubial joys<br />
“Beheld; when chasing dusky darkness far,<br />
“Aurora ruddy, saw me on the heights<br />
“Hymettus flowery rears, as there my toils<br />
“For antler'd stags I spread: and there by force<br />
“She clasp'd me. Truth I wish to guide my tongue<br />
“Nor yet displease the goddess, when I swear<br />
“Though bright her roseate cheeks; though wide she sways<br />
“Of night and day the confines; though she quaffs<br />
“Nectarean liquid, still I Procris lov'd:<br />
“Still in my bosom Procris reign'd, and still<br />
“Procris, my tongue repeated. Oft I urg'd<br />
<a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;278]</span>
“The sacred couch, the new-felt joys, the rites<br />
“So recent, and the plighted faith just given,<br />
“To her deserted: when the goddess flam'd,<br />
“Exclaiming;&mdash;Ingrate! cease thy doleful plaints,<br />
“Enjoy thy Procris,&mdash;if I right foresee<br />
“Thou'lt rue that wish'd enjoyment:&mdash;Angry thus<br />
“She fled me. Slow returning, much I mus'd,<br />
“The goddess' words recalling: fear me thrill'd,<br />
“Lest Procris had her nuptial oaths profaned.<br />
“Her age, her beauty, much suspicion mov'd;<br />
“Her virtue bade me chase my fears as vain.<br />
“Yet was I absent, and from whence I came,<br />
“Prov'd how adulterous females might indulge,<br />
“Suspicious love fears all. Studious I seek,<br />
“What found would rack with torture; and I burn<br />
“To bribe with gifts, and try her modest faith.<br />
“Aurora aids my fears, my shape transforms:<br />
“(Conscious I felt it.) To Minerva's town,<br />
“To all unknown, I hastened, and my house<br />
“Enter'd: the house in faultless guise I found;<br />
“Chaste all appear'd, and anxious all were seen<br />
“For their lost master. By a thousand arts<br />
“Erechtheus' daughter I at length beheld,<br />
“And seen was stagger'd: near my purpos'd proof<br />
“Relinquish'd of fidelity; most hard<br />
“The cheat to tell not; to refrain most hard<br />
“From conjugal salutes. Sad she appear'd.<br />
<a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;279]</span>
“But nought more lovely could in sadness seem:<br />
“Burning in wishes for her absent spouse.<br />
“Image, O, Phocus! what her beauteous face<br />
“Could boast; a face that woe itself became.<br />
“Why should I tell how oft her virtuous soul,<br />
“Repuls'd my tempting offers? Why repeat<br />
“How oft she cry'd;&mdash;For one myself I keep,<br />
“For one, where'er he stays, my joys preserve.<br />
“Whose mad suspicion would not this allay?<br />
“This proof of faith? But I, not so content,<br />
“Strive for my own confusion. Lavish gifts<br />
“I proffer for the joys of one short night:<br />
“More and more rich I heap them, till her breast<br />
“Wavers, then loud exclaim,&mdash;Lo! here behold,<br />
“Adulteress! one unluckily disguis'd,<br />
“Unluckily betroth'd, thy lawful spouse!<br />
“Perfidious! by those eyes convinc'd I stand.<br />
“Nought she:&mdash;with silent shame o'ercome, she fled<br />
“The house deceitful, and her hated spouse.<br />
“With me offended, all the race of men<br />
“Detesting, on the mountain tops she rov'd;<br />
“Diana's sports close following. Fiercer love<br />
“Flam'd in my bosom, thus deserted left.<br />
“I su'd for pardon, and my fault I own'd;<br />
“Swore that myself so tempted, so had err'd,<br />
“By such high offers brib'd. Confessing thus,<br />
<a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;280]</span>
“Her wounded modest pride grew more compos'd;<br />
“And shortly I regain'd her. Long in peace<br />
“We liv'd, and cordial spent the smiling years.<br />
“Herself a gift she priz'd not: more she gave,<br />
“An hound, she from Diana's hand receiv'd,<br />
“Who said,&mdash;accept the fleetest of his race&mdash;<br />
“And gave this javelin which you see me bear.<br />
“If of the first the fate you seek to know,<br />
“Attend, th' adventure will your wonder move.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The son of Laïus had the words explain'd,<br />
“Before his time to every mind obscure;<br />
“And the dark prophetess, down headlong flung,<br />
“Laid lifeless, all her riddling tales forgot.<br />
“Her, fostering Themis saw, and unreveng'd<br />
“To lie not suffer'd. Straight another plague<br />
“On Thebes was loos'd; and all the country swains<br />
“Fear'd by the savage beast their flocks to lose,<br />
“And fear'd their own destruction. With the youths<br />
“Adjacent, I assembled; round the fields<br />
“Our toils we fix; the toils the rapid beast<br />
“O'erleaps high-bounding; 'bove the loftiest ropes,<br />
“Stretch'd o'er the nets, with active spring he flies.<br />
“The hounds uncoupled, in the chace he mocks,<br />
“And like an agile bird before them plays;<br />
“With outcries loud, for Lælaps' aid they call.<br />
<a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;281]</span>
“(My Procris' gift, so nam'd.) Long had he tugg'd,<br />
“To extricate him from the chain; to free<br />
“His captive neck: scarce was he loos'd, so swift<br />
“He shot, in vain our eyes his progress mark'd:<br />
“In the light dust his feet were printed, he,<br />
“Rapt from the view, was vanish'd. Swifter flies<br />
“The darted spear not: nor the leaden ball<br />
“Hurl'd from the whirling sling;&mdash;nor reedy dart<br />
“Shot from the Cretan bow. A central hill<br />
“High-towering, all the subject plains o'erlooks;<br />
“Thither I climb, and there behold the chase;<br />
“A novel scene. Now seems the beast safe caught;<br />
“Now from the grasp light-springing. Flight right on<br />
“Crafty he shuns, and doubles round the field,<br />
“Cheating his chaser's mouth; and circling turns<br />
“His foe's quick speed eluding. Swift he flies,&mdash;<br />
“With equal swiftness follow'd. Now to grasp<br />
“His prey seems Lælaps,&mdash;in his grasp deceiv'd,<br />
“His empty jaws seize air. Now to my aid<br />
“I call my javelin,&mdash;poize it for the blow,<br />
“And bend mine eyes the thongs to fix secure:<br />
“Again I lift them to behold the chase,<br />
“And see astonish'd in the spacious plain<br />
“Two marble statues! this to fly appears,&mdash;<br />
“That barking seems to follow. So decreed<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far he spoke, then silent sate.&mdash;“What crime,”<br />
Said Phocus&mdash;“has the javelin then perform'd?”&mdash;<br />
And thus the javelin's fault the hero tells,<br />
“Since joys supreme my sorrows first forewent,<br />
“Let me, O, Phocus! first those joys recount.<br />
“O, youth! how it delights me to retrace<br />
“Those happy moments, when supremely blest<br />
“In her, the primal years were joyous spent.<br />
“She, equal happy in her darling spouse;<br />
“Each mind of mutual care a portion bore;<br />
“And love's connubial joys each equal shar'd.<br />
“Jove's proffer'd couch, with my embrace compar'd,<br />
“Procris had spurn'd; nor could the loveliest nymph<br />
“Me tempt, though Venus' self had deign'd to sue:<br />
“In either breast an equal ardor flam'd.<br />
“In youthful guise I wont the woods to scour,<br />
“For sport betimes, ere yet the sun had ting'd<br />
“With early beams the lofty mountains' tops:<br />
“Nor took I servants, nor the courser fleet,<br />
“Nor hounds sharp-scented, nor the knotted snares;<br />
“This dart my sole dependence: when my arm<br />
“With slaughtered spoil was satiate, tir'd I sought<br />
“The cooling shade, and sought where Aura breath'd<br />
“In frigid vales her breezes. 'Midst the heat<br />
“Refreshing air I sought, and Aura call'd,<br />
“My labour's recreation; thus I sung,<br />
“I well the words remember;&mdash;Aura, come!<br />
<a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;283]</span>
“Come, my delight,&mdash;within my bosom creep,<br />
“Most grateful friend; come, and as wont remove<br />
“My inward flames.&mdash;By chance more tender words<br />
“(So sway'd my destiny) to these I join'd:<br />
“And thus I spoke&mdash;O, thou! my greatest joy<br />
“Refreshing, cherishing my strength and power!<br />
“For thee, these woods and lonely spots I love:<br />
“Here does my wishing mouth thy breath inhale.&mdash;<br />
“These words ambiguous, busy ears receiv'd,<br />
“And Aura! Aura! oft invok'd, they deem<br />
“A favor'd nymph,&mdash;a nymph by me belov'd.<br />
“The rash informer with the imag'd wrong,<br />
“My Procris seeks his whispering tongue relates,<br />
“The words o'erheard. Love credulous believes.<br />
“O'erpress'd with grief, she sudden sunk, when heard<br />
“The tale,&mdash;and long she unrecover'd laid.<br />
“Then&mdash;hapless wife!&mdash;O, wayward fate! she cries:&mdash;<br />
“My broken faith bewails, and with my crime<br />
“Imagin'd, troubled, fears what not exists,&mdash;<br />
“A name without a being: much she grieves,<br />
“As real were her rival: yet full oft<br />
“Stagger'd, she doubts, and hopes herself deceiv'd:<br />
“Trusts not th' informer; and her husband's fault,<br />
“Unless beheld, refuses to believe.<br />
“When next Aurora bade the darkness fly<br />
“I sally'd forth, and sought th' accustomed wood:<br />
“Then tir'd with conquest, on the grass I stretch'd,<br />
<a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;284]</span>
“And,&mdash;come, dear Aura, ease my pain,&mdash;I cry'd<br />
“Sudden a mournful sigh betwixt my words<br />
“I heard, but still proceeded,&mdash;dearest, come!&mdash;<br />
“Again the falling leaves a rustling sound<br />
“Causing, a savage beast I thought lay hid,<br />
“And hurl'd my faithful dart. Procris was there!<br />
“And as her tender breast the blow receiv'd<br />
“Alas! she cry'd.&mdash;My faithful spouse's voice<br />
“I knew, and with distracted speed I ran;<br />
“Half-dead I found her, all her robes distain'd<br />
“With flowing blood,&mdash;and dragging from the wound,<br />
“Ah, me!&mdash;her fatal gift. My guilty arms,<br />
“Her body, dearer far than mine, support;<br />
“My vest I rend, the cruel gash to bind,<br />
“And check the gushing blood; I fearful pray,<br />
“She will not leave me guilty of her fate.<br />
“She now, her strength fast wasting, dying fast,<br />
“These words to utter try'd:&mdash;Suppliant I beg,<br />
“By all the oaths that form'd our nuptial ties;<br />
“By all the gods and goddesses above;<br />
“By all my actions which have given you joy;<br />
“By that strong love which thus my fate has caus'd,<br />
“Which now in death my bosom still retains,<br />
“Let not this Aura to my bed succeed.&mdash;<br />
“She said,&mdash;too late I learn'd, too late I told<br />
“The error of the name; for what avail'd!<br />
“She sinks, her small remaining strength is fled,<br />
<a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;285]</span>
“Her last blood flows. While ought she seems to view,<br />
“On me she bends her eyes; her hapless soul<br />
“My lips inhale, yet pleas'd her brow appears<br />
“In death, more calm from what I just explain'd.”<br />
Thus grieving, Cephalus concludes, and all<br />
His audience with him weep. When, lo! appear<br />
King Æäcus, his sons, and troops new-rais'd;<br />
Whom Cephalus, in warlike strength, receives.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now leading Phosphor' shining day disclos'd,<br />
The darkness flying; and the eastern gales<br />
Lull'd into calm, the vapoury clouds arose:<br />
The placid south befriending, rapid borne,<br />
The hero Cephalus, and aiding troops,<br />
Ride unexpected in their wish'd-for port.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minos, meanwhile, the Lelegeian coast<br />
Lays waste, and on Alcathoë's town his power<br />
Essays. Here Nisus rul'd, whose reverend locks<br />
Of silvery brightness, in the midst contain'd<br />
<a name="page_2_4"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
One with rich purple splendid, sacred pledge<br />
Of fortune to his kingdom. Six times seen<br />
Were Luna's horns arising fresh renew'd;<br />
Still hover'd conquest doubtful o'er the war,<br />
On wavering pinions, 'twixt opposing hosts.<br />
A regal tower its vocal walls high-rear'd,<br />
Where once Latona's son his golden lyre<br />
Rested; the music still the stones retain'd.<br />
Oft here the beauteous daughter of the king<br />
Ascended, and the latent music drew<br />
Forth to the ear, by smallest pebbles struck.<br />
Thus she in peaceful times, and here she oft<br />
When war was raging, ventur'd: hence she saw<br />
The rough encounters of the furious field.<br />
So long the tedious warfare, well she knew<br />
The leaders' names, their arms, their prancing steeds:<br />
And knew their garments, and their Cretan bows.<br />
Far beyond all Europa's son she knew,<br />
More than became her state: this Minos well<br />
Could prove; whose head in crested helmet hid,<br />
Most beauteous helm'd appear'd: whose arm, adorn'd<br />
With brazen shield refulgent, well became<br />
The brazen shield: whose hand the tough lance whirl'd,<br />
And back withdrawn, the virgin wondering prais'd<br />
Such strength and skill combin'd: to fit the dart<br />
When to the spreading bow his strength he bent,<br />
She vow'd that Ph&oelig;bus in such posture stood<br />
<a name="page_2_5"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
His arrows fitting: when, his brazen casque<br />
Relinquish'd, all his features shone display'd,<br />
As purple-rob'd his snow-white steed he press'd,<br />
In painted housings gay, and curb'd his jaws<br />
White foaming,&mdash;then the lost Nisean maid,<br />
Scarcely herself, in frantic rapture spoke:&mdash;<br />
Blest call'd the javelin, that his hands it touch'd;<br />
Blest call'd the reins he curb'd. Arduous she burns,<br />
(Could she) through hostile ranks her virgin steps<br />
To bend: arduous she burns, from loftiest towers<br />
To fling her body in the Cretan camp.<br />
The brazen portals of the city's walls<br />
Wide to the foe she'd ope: what could she not?<br />
That Minos will'd? As resting here she view'd,<br />
The white pavilion of the Gnossian king<br />
Dubious, she cry'd;&mdash;“Or should I grieve or joy,<br />
“This mournful war to witness? Grieve I must<br />
“That Minos so belov'd should be my foe.<br />
“But had the war not been, his lovely face<br />
“Had ne'er to me been known. Now war may cease<br />
“Should I become the hostage:&mdash;I retain'd,<br />
“As Minos' comrade, and the pledge of peace.<br />
“Fairest of forms! if she who brought thee forth<br />
“Resembled thee, well might an amorous god<br />
“Burn for her beauty. O! thrice blest were I,<br />
“If borne through air on lightly-waving wings,<br />
“The Cretan monarch's camp I might explore,<br />
<a name="page_2_6"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
“And there, my rank and love disclos'd, demand<br />
“What dowry he would ask to be my spouse.<br />
“My country's towers alone, he should not seek.<br />
“Perish the joys of his expected bed,<br />
“Ere I through treason gain them! Yet full oft<br />
“A moderate victor's clemency affords<br />
“Great blessings to the vanquish'd. Doubtless, he<br />
“Just warfare wages for his murder'd son.<br />
“Strong in his cause, and in his armies strong,<br />
“Which aid that cause, he must the conquest gain.<br />
“Why, if this fate my country waits, should war,<br />
“And not my love unbar to him the gates?<br />
“So may he conquer; slaughter, toil, and blood,&mdash;<br />
“His own dear blood, avoided. How I dread,<br />
“Lest some rash hand might that lov'd bosom wound!<br />
“None but the ignorant sure, the savage spear<br />
“At him would hurl. The scheme delights my soul:<br />
“Fixt my resolve; my country as my dower<br />
“Will I deliver, finish so the war!<br />
“But what are resolutions? Watchful guards<br />
“The passes keep; of every gate, the keys<br />
“My father careful holds. Hapless! I dread<br />
“My father only; he alone withstands<br />
“My wishes; would that so the gods had doom'd,<br />
“I had no parent! But to each himself<br />
“A god may surely be; and fortune spurns<br />
“Lazy beseechers. With such love inflam'd,<br />
<a name="page_2_7"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
“Another maid had long ere now destroy'd<br />
“All barriers to her bliss; and why than I,<br />
“Should any dare more boldly? Fearless, I<br />
“Thro' swords and flames would pass, but swords and flames<br />
“Oppose me not in this: my sole desire<br />
“Compris'd in one small lock of Nisus' hair:<br />
“Than gold that prize more dear. That purple lock<br />
“Most blest would make me, and my sole desires<br />
“Encompass.”&mdash;Speaking thus, the gloomy night,<br />
Imperial nurse of cares, approach'd; more bold<br />
Her daring project with the darkness grew.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now primal slumbers rul'd o'er weary breasts,<br />
Tir'd with their toil diurnal. Silent, she<br />
Her father's chamber enters, and (O, dire!)<br />
The daughter from her parent's head divides<br />
The fateful lock! Her wicked prize possess'd,<br />
Forth from the gate she issues; and the spoil,<br />
So cursed, with her bears; as through the hosts,<br />
(Such boldness gave the deed,) she seeks the king,<br />
Whom thus, astonish'd and aghast, she hails:&mdash;<br />
“To wicked deeds love sways; behold me here,<br />
“Scylla, from royal Nisus sprung; to thee<br />
“My household gods and country I betray:<br />
“Thee, sole reward I seek. Pledge of my faith,<br />
“This purple lock receive, and with this lock<br />
“Receive my parent's head.”&mdash;Then in her hand<br />
<a name="page_2_8"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
The impious gift presented. Minos spurn'd<br />
The parricidal present; deeply shock'd<br />
A deed so base to witness, and exclaim'd;&mdash;<br />
“May all the gods, from every part of earth<br />
“Thee banish, scandal of our age! may land<br />
“And sea alike reject thee; such a soul<br />
“So monstrous! ne'er with me shall touch the shores<br />
“Of Crete, my land, and cradle of high Jove.”<br />
He said, and on his captive foes impos'd<br />
Most just his equal laws; his men bade loose<br />
Their cables from the beach, and with their oars<br />
His vessels bright with brass, urge on the deep.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launch'd on the main, when Scylla sees the fleet,<br />
Nor from its leader gain'd the hop'd reward,<br />
Her wicked deed had sought, tir'd of her prayers,<br />
In desperate rage she storms; wild throws her hair;<br />
Stretches her hands, exclaiming;&mdash;“Where! O, where!<br />

Scarce ending, in the waves she furious leaped,<br />
Vigorous by love, and gain'd the flying fleet;<br />
And clasp'd, unwelcome guest, the Gnossian poop.<br />
Here soon her father spy'd her (in the air<br />
He wing'd his way, now cloth'd with yellow plumes<br />
A falcon) and down darted; with his beak<br />
So curv'd, to wound her as she clung. In dread<br />
Her grasp she loos'd, and as she seem'd to fall,<br />
The light air bore her from the waves below:<br />
Plum'd she became, and form'd a feather'd bird,<br />
Ciris they call'd her from the ravish'd lock.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Jove now Minos all his vows performs,<br />
An hecatomb of bulls; as from the fleet<br />

He lands on Gnossus' shores: his royal hall<br />
With all his spoils, on high uphung, adorn'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime th' opprobrium of his bed increas'd:<br />
The two-formed monster in a novel birth,<br />
At length the mother's beastly crime proclaim'd.<br />
Minos, the shameful witness from his couch,<br />
Far to remove determines; in a dome<br />
Intricate winding, he resolves to lodge,<br />
From every eye conceal'd, the birth. Intrusts<br />
The work to Dædalus, in cunning arts<br />
Most fam'd, to build. He all the various marks,<br />
Confuses, puzzles; bent on either side,<br />
The various paths confound the searching eye.<br />
So in the fields the soft Mæander plays,<br />
Here refluent, flowing there with dubious course;<br />
Meeting himself, his wandering stream he sees:<br />
And urges now to whence he first arose;<br />
Now to the open outlet of the main.<br />
Thus Dædalus the numerous paths perplex'd<br />
With puzzlings intricate, so much entwin'd,<br />
Himself could scarce the outer threshold gain.<br />
Here was the double monster, man and bull<br />
Inclos'd; till by the third allotted tribe,<br />
The ninth year, vanquish'd; with Athenian blood<br />
Twice gorg'd before. Then was the secret gate,<br />
So often sought in vain, found by the aid<br />

A virgin lent to trace the winding clue.<br />
Instant for Dias, Theseus loos'd his sails,<br />
With Minos' ravish'd daughter: on that shore<br />
Cruel! he left her. The deserted nymph<br />
Wildly lamenting, Bacchus soon embrac'd,<br />
And gave her needful aid; her fame to fix<br />
Immortal in the skies, her sparkling crown,<br />
Mov'd from her forehead, 'mid the stars he plac'd:<br />
Through the thin air it flies, and as it mounts<br />
To blazing stars, the glittering jewels change.<br />
Still as a crown it shines, its station 'midst<br />
Where stout Alcides Ophiuchus grasps.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime long exile, and the land of Crete<br />
Detesting; burning with a patriot's wish<br />
His native soil to visit, Dædalus,<br />
By sea escape prevented, thus exclaim'd;&mdash;<br />
“Let earth and ocean both my flight obstruct,<br />
“Still open lies the air; through air we'll go.<br />
“Minos controlling all, controls not air.”&mdash;<br />
He speaks, and bends to unknown arts his skill,<br />
Improving Nature's gift. Quills fixt in rows<br />
He places; small at first in length and size,<br />
Gradual enlarg'd, as if a hill's steep side<br />
Growing, produc'd them: So time past the pipe,<br />
Of rustic origin, by small degrees<br />
Increasing reeds compos'd. Firm fixt with thread<br />
<a name="page_2_13"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
Their middle part he binds, and close with wax<br />
Cements their bottom. All complete he bends<br />
The composition in a gentle curve,<br />
Resembling real wings. Young Icarus<br />
Alone was present; ignorant that the work<br />
Would his destruction cause; with playful tricks<br />
He fingers now the feathers, now his hands<br />
Soften the yellow wax. His sportive wiles<br />
His father's wond'rous essay oft delay.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now was the last completing stroke impos'd<br />
Upon his undertaking: First the sire<br />
On artificial wings his body pois'd,<br />
And in the beaten air suspended hung:<br />
Then his young offspring, Icarus, he taught.&mdash;<br />
“This I my son advise, a middle course,<br />
“To keep be cautious; low if thou should'st skim,<br />
“Heavy with ocean's spray thy wings would droop:<br />
“If high, the sun would scorch them. Steer thy course<br />
“'Twixt each extreme. Nor would I wish thine eyes<br />
“To view Boötes, or the northern bear;<br />
“Nor yet Orion's naked sword. My track<br />
“Cautious pursue.”&mdash;With anxious care he gives<br />
Rules thus for flight; and to his shoulders fits<br />
The new-form'd pinions. Tears his ancient cheeks<br />
Bedew'd, as thus his admonitions flow'd:<br />
And his paternal hands as thus employ'd,<br />
<a name="page_2_14"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
Beneath the office trembled. Warm salutes<br />
He gave the boy, nor knew he gave the last;<br />
Then on his feathers borne, explores the way,<br />
Timid for him who follows. So the bird,<br />
Tempts from her lofty nest her new-fledg'd brood,<br />
In the thin air. He bids him close pursue,<br />
Tries in each shape to teach the fatal skill;<br />
Shakes his own pinions, bending back to view<br />
His son's. The angler as with quivering reed,<br />
He drew his prey to land; the shepherd-swain,<br />
As o'er his staff he lean'd; the ploughman-clown,<br />
Their flight astonish'd saw, and deem'd them gods,<br />
That so at will could cleave the liquid sky.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Samos, Juno's favor'd isle they pass'd,<br />
Delos, and Paros, all to left;&mdash;to right<br />
Labyrithos lay, and rich in honey'd sweets<br />
Calymné: when the heedless boy o'erjoy'd<br />
In his bold flight, the precepts of his guide<br />
Contemning, soar'd to heaven a loftier range.<br />
The neighbouring sun's fierce heat the fragrant wax<br />
Which bound, his pinions, soften'd. Soon the wax<br />
Dissolves; and now his naked arms he waves;<br />
But destitute of power his course to steer,<br />
No air his arms can gather; loud he calls<br />
His father's name, as in the azure deep<br />
He drops,&mdash;the deep which still his name retains.<br />
<a name="page_2_15"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hapless parent, not a parent now,<br />
Loud calls on Icarus;&mdash;“Where art thou, son?<br />
“Where shall I seek thee, Icarus?”&mdash;He said,<br />
And spy'd his feathers floating on the waves:<br />
Then curs'd his hapless art, as in the earth,<br />
He deep intomb'd him; all the land around<br />
Bears from the youth intomb'd its present name.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whirring partridge, from a branchy holm<br />
Beheld him, as beneath the turf he plac'd<br />
His son's lamented body, and with joy<br />
Flutter'd his feathers; while his chirping song<br />
Proclaim'd his gladness: then the only bird<br />
Known of his kind, in elder days unseen;<br />
But lately cloth'd with feathers, through the crime<br />
Flagitious, Dædalus, of thee! To thee,<br />
Thy sister, witless how his fate was doom'd,<br />
Her son committed for instructing art,<br />
When twice six annual suns the youth had seen;<br />
His docile mind best fitted then to learn.<br />
He well th' indented bones remark'd, which form<br />
The fish's spiny back, and in like mode,<br />
Sharp steel indenting, first the saw produc'd<br />
For public service. Two steel arms he join'd<br />
Fixt to one orb above; each widely stretch'd,<br />
One steady rests, the other circling turns.<br />
Him Dædalus with envy viewing, forc'd<br />
<a name="page_2_16"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
Headlong, from sacred Pallas' lofty tower,<br />
His death feign'd accidental: but the maid<br />
Divine, to all ingenious minds a friend,<br />
Receiv'd him in his fall; chang'd to a bird,<br />
On pinions bore him through the middle air.<br />
His vigorous powers in force remain the same,<br />
But change their seat; rapid he flies, and quick<br />
He races on the ground; his name remains<br />
Unalter'd: still the cautious bird declines<br />
To trust his weight aloft, nor forms his nest<br />
On lofty boughs, or summits of high trees:<br />
Nigh to the earth he skims; beneath the hedge<br />
His shelly brood deposits; of his fall<br />
Still mindful, towering heights he always shuns.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Dædalus, with lengthen'd flight fatigu'd,<br />
Sicilia's realm receiv'd; whose king humane,<br />
Great Cocalus, mov'd with his suppliant pray'r,<br />
Arm'd to assist him. Now by Theseus freed,<br />
Athens no more the mournful tribute paid.<br />
With garlands every temple gay they hang,<br />
Invoke the warlike maid, the mighty Jove,<br />
And every deity: their altars all<br />
With promis'd blood they honor; with rich gifts,<br />
And fragrant incense. Now had wandering fame<br />
Through all the Grecian towns, spread the renown<br />
Of Theseus: and the rich Achaïa's tribes<br />
<a name="page_2_17"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
His aid implor'd, when mighty perils press'd.<br />
Ev'n Calydon, though Meleager brave<br />
Possessing, sought his help with suppliant words.<br />
The cause, a furious boar by Dian' sent,<br />
Avenging instrument of slighted power.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&OElig;neus, from plenteous harvests' full success<br />
Rejoicing, primal fruits to Ceres gave;<br />
To Bacchus pour'd libations of his wine;<br />
To yellow-hair'd Minerva offer'd oil:<br />
The rites invidious, from the rural gods<br />
Commencing, all the bright celestials shar'd.<br />
Latona's daughter only, in her fane,<br />
Nor flames nor offerings on her altar saw.<br />
Rage fires ev'n heavenly breasts.&mdash;“Not unreveng'd,”&mdash;<br />
She cry'd,&mdash;shall this be suffer'd; honor'd not!<br />
“Not unappeas'd by vengeance will I rest.”&mdash;<br />
Then through th' &OElig;neian fields the maid, despis'd,<br />
Sends the fierce boar to ravage. Such his size,<br />
The bulls that in Epirus' pastures graze<br />
More huge appear not: in Sicilia's meads<br />
Far less are seen. Red are his sparkling eyes,<br />
Fire mixt with blood; high rears his fearful neck,<br />
Thick clustering spears the threatening bristles seem:<br />
Hoarse as he grunts, down his wide shoulders spreads<br />
The boiling foam: his tusks the tusks outvie<br />
Of India's hugest beast: the lightening's blast,<br />
<a name="page_2_18"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>
Driven from his mouth, burns all the verdant leaves.<br />
Now o'er the corn, but yet in budding ears,<br />
He tramples, immature he reaps the crop;<br />
The loud-lamenting tiller's hopes destroy'd:<br />
The harvest intercepting in the shoot.<br />
In vain the barns, the granaries in vain,<br />
Their promis'd loads expect. Prostrate alike<br />
Are thrown the fruitful clusters of the vine,<br />
With shooting tendrils; and the olive's fruit<br />
With branches ever-blooming. On the flocks<br />
He rages: these not shepherds, not their dogs<br />
Could save; nor could the furious bull his herd.<br />
Wide fled the people; safety none durst hope<br />
Save in their cities' walls; till thirst of fame<br />
Fir'd Meleager, with his chosen band<br />
Of valiant youths. And first were seen the twins<br />
Of Tyndarus, for wond'rous skill renown'd,<br />
This at the cæstus, that to curb the steed:<br />
Jason, whose art the primal ship design'd:<br />
Theseus, in happy concord with his friend<br />
Pirithous, join'd: Thestius' two valiant sons:<br />
Lynceus, Aphareus' offspring: Idas swift:<br />
Leucippus fierce: Acastus unexcell'd<br />
To dart the javelin: Cæneus, now no more<br />
Cloth'd in a female figure: Ph&oelig;nix, sprung<br />
From old Amyntor: Actor's equal sons:<br />
Hippothoös: Dryas: and from Elis' town<br />
<a name="page_2_19"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
Dispatch'd, came Phileus. Nor was absent there,<br />
Brave Telamon, nor great Achilles' sire:<br />
Nor stout Eurytion; with Pheretus' son:<br />
Nor Hyantean Iölaüs brave:<br />
Echion in speed unconquer'd: Nestor then<br />
In primal youth: Lelex, Narycian born:<br />
Panopeus: Hyleus: Hippasus the fierce:<br />
Nor those whom Hippocoön sent in aid,<br />
From old Amyclæ: nor Ulysses' sire:<br />
Ancæus of Parrhasia: Mopsus sage:<br />
Amphiareus, then by his false spouse's guile<br />
Betray'd not. With them Atalanta came,<br />
The grace and glory of Arcadia's woods.<br />
A shining buckle from the ground confin'd<br />
Her garment's border: simply bound, her hair<br />
One knot confin'd: her ivory quiver, slung<br />
O'er her left shoulder, sounded as she stepp'd:<br />
Her hand sustain'd a bow: and thus array'd<br />
Appear'd her form. Her lineaments disclos'd,<br />
What scarce might feminine in boys appear;<br />
Or hardly boyish in a virgin's face.<br />
The chief of Calydon the maid beheld,&mdash;<br />
Beheld, and lov'd: while heaven his love oppos'd.<br />
The secret flames inhaling deep, he cry'd,&mdash;<br />
“O, blessed youth! if youth to gain thy hand<br />
“Worthy were deem'd!”&mdash;Nor bashful shame, nor time<br />
<a name="page_2_20"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
Would more allow; a mightier deed now claim'd<br />
Their utmost efforts for the furious war.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darken'd with trees thick-growing, rose a wood;<br />
From earliest ages there the biting axe<br />
Had never sounded; in the plain it rear'd<br />
Facing the sloping fields. The youths arriv'd;<br />
Some spread the knotted toils; some loose the hounds;<br />
Some strive the foot-prints of the boar to trace,<br />
Their danger anxious seeking. Low beneath<br />
A hollow vale extended, where the floods<br />
Fresh showery torrents gather'd, lazy laid.<br />
The flexile willow, and the waving reed;<br />
The fenny bulrush, osier, and the cane<br />
Diminutive, the stagnant depth conceal'd.<br />
Arous'd from hence, the boar impetuous rush'd<br />
Amidst his host of foes; so lightenings dart<br />
When clouds concussive clash. His rapid force<br />
Levels the grove, the crackling trees resound<br />
Where'er he pushes: loud the joyful youth<br />
Exclaim, each grasping with a nervous hand<br />
His weapon brandish'd, while its broad head shakes.<br />
Forward he darts, the dogs he scatters wide,<br />
And each opposing power; his strokes oblique<br />
Their baying drives to distance. Echion's arm<br />
Hurl'd the first dart, but hurl'd the dart in vain;<br />
Lightly a maple's trunk the weapon graz'd.<br />
<a name="page_2_21"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
The next, but over-urg'd the force that sent,<br />
Had pierc'd the rough back of the wish'd-for prey;<br />
Jason's the steel,&mdash;it whizz'd beyond him far.<br />
Then Mopsus pray'd,&mdash;“O Ph&oelig;bus! if thy rites<br />
“I e'er perform'd, if still I thee adore,<br />
“Grant my sure weapon what I wish to touch.”<br />
The god consented, what he could he gave,&mdash;<br />
The boar was struck, but struck without a wound:<br />
Diana from the flying weapon snatch'd<br />
The steely head, and pointless fell the wood.<br />
More chafes the beast, like lightening fierce he burns,<br />
Fire from his eyeballs flashes, from his chest<br />
Clouds of hot smoke through his wide nostrils roll.<br />
Forc'd from the close-drawn string as flies a stone,<br />
Hurl'd at embattl'd walls, or hostile towers<br />
With foes thick crowded: so the deadly beast<br />
Rush'd on the heroes with unerring shock.<br />
Eupalamus and Pelagon, who stood<br />
The right wing guarding, on the earth he threw:<br />
Their fellows snatch'd them from impending fate.<br />
Not so Onesimus, of Hippocoön<br />
The offspring, 'scap'd the death-inflicting blow;<br />
Torn through the ham, just as for flight he turn'd;<br />
His slacken'd nerves could bear his weight no more.<br />
Then Nestor too, long e'er the Trojan times,<br />
Perchance had perish'd, but beside him stood<br />
A tree, whose branches nimbly he attain'd;<br />
<a name="page_2_22"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;22]</span>
A mighty effort, aided by his spear:<br />
Safe in his seat, he view'd the foe he fled,<br />
Beneath him. Fiercely threatening death below,<br />
He whets his tushes on a stumpy oak,<br />
And bold in sharpen'd arms, ranches the thigh,<br />
With crooked fangs, of Othrys' mighty son.<br />
Now the twin-brothers, ere in heaven display'd<br />
Bright constellations, both fair dazzling shone,<br />
Mounted on steeds, whose lily'd hue surpass'd<br />
Th' unsully'd snow; both shook their brandish'd spears,<br />
The trembling motion sounded high in air;<br />
Deep both had pierc'd, but 'mid the darkening trees,<br />
Their bristly foe sought refuge, where nor steed,<br />
Nor dart could reach him. Telamon pursues;<br />
Ardent, and heedless of his steps, a root<br />
Checks his quick feet, and prone the hero falls.<br />
While Peleus aids his brother chief to rise,<br />
The beauteous Atalanta to the string<br />
Fits the swift dart, and from the bended bow<br />
Speeds it; the arrow, fixt beneath his ear,<br />
Razes the monster's skin, and drops of blood<br />
His bristly neck ensanguine. Joys the maid<br />
To see the blow;&mdash;but Meleager far<br />
In joy surpass'd her. He the first beheld<br />
The trickling blood; he to his comrades first<br />
The wound display'd, exclaiming,&mdash;“Yon fair nymph<br />
“The honors so deserv'dly won shall bear.”&mdash;<br />
<a name="page_2_23"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;23]</span>
The warriors blush with shame, and each exhorts<br />
His fellow; shouts their souls more valiant swell;<br />
In heaps confus'd their numerous javelins fly;<br />
Clashing in crowds, each javelin fails to wound.<br />
Lo! now Ancæus furious, to his fate<br />
Blind rushing, rears his double axe, and cries,&mdash;<br />
“Behold, O youths! how much a manly arm<br />
“Outstrikes a female's, to my prowess yield<br />
“The palm of conquest. Let Latona's maid<br />
“With all her power protect him, yet my force,<br />
“Spite of Diana, shall the monster slay.”&mdash;<br />
Proud his big-boasting tongue thus speaks, then grasps<br />
His two-edg'd weapon firmly in his hands,<br />
And rais'd on tiptoe meditates the blow.<br />
The watchful beast prevents him, through his groin,<br />
To death sure passage, drives his double tusks:<br />
Ancæus drops; his bowels gushing fall,<br />
Roll on the earth, and soak the ground in gore.<br />
Ixion's son, Pirithous, on the foe<br />
Rush'd, in his nervous hand a powerful spear<br />
Brandishing; Theseus loudly to his friend<br />
Exclaim'd,&mdash;“O, dearer far than is myself,&mdash;<br />
“Half of my soul, at distance wait; the brave<br />
“At distance may engage; valor too rash<br />
“Destroy'd Ancæus.”&mdash;As he spoke he hurl'd<br />
His massive cornel spear; its brazen head<br />
Well pois'd, its sender's anxious wish appear'd<br />
<a name="page_2_24"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;24]</span>
Fair to accomplish, when a leafy arm<br />
Branch'd from a beech, oppos'd it in its flight.<br />
Next Æson's son, his javelin threw, but chance<br />
Glanc'd from its mark the weapon, and transpierc'd<br />
An undeserving hound; the dart was drove<br />
Through all his belly, and deep fixt in earth.<br />
But different fortune on the arms awaits<br />
Of Meleager, javelins two he sent;<br />
Deep in the ground the foremost pierc'd, the next<br />
Firm in the monster's back quivering stood fixt.<br />
Nor stays he, whilst he raging furious whirl'd<br />
In giddy circles round, and pour'd his foam,<br />
Mad with the new-felt torture, close at hand<br />
The hero plies his work, provokes his foe<br />
To fiercer ire, and in his furious breast<br />
Buries the glittering spear. A second shout<br />
Loudly proclaims his thronging comrades' joy;<br />
Each to the victor crowding, hand in hand<br />
Congratulating grasps him; each amaz'd<br />
Views the dire savage, as his mighty bulk<br />
O'erspreads a space of land. Scarce think they yet<br />
Their safety sure, him touching; each his spear<br />
Extends, and dips it in the flowing gore.<br />
His foot upon the head destructive fixt,<br />
The conquering youth thus speaks:&mdash;“Nonacria fair!<br />
“Receive the spoil my fortune well might claim:<br />
“Fresh glory shall I gain, with thee to share<br />
<a name="page_2_25"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
“The honors of the day.”&mdash;Then gives the spoils;&mdash;<br />
The chine with horrid bristles rising stiff,<br />
And head, fierce threatening still with mighty tusks.<br />
She takes the welcome gift, for much she joys<br />
From him to take it. Envy seiz'd the rest,<br />
And sullen murmurs through the comrades ran:<br />
Above the rest, were Thestius' sons,&mdash;their arms<br />
Out-stretching, clamor'd thus with a mighty noise;&mdash;<br />
“Let not thy beauteous form thy mind deceive,<br />
“When from thy eyes the donor of the spoil,<br />
“Besotted with thy love, shall far be mov'd.<br />
“Woman! restore the prize, nor hope to hold<br />
“Our intercepted claims.”&mdash;Speaking they rob<br />
Her of the gift, him of the right to give.<br />
Nor passive stood the warlike youth, his teeth<br />
He gnash'd with swelling rage, as fierce he cry'd;&mdash;<br />
“Learn, ye base robbers of another's rights,<br />
“What difference threats and valiant actions shew.&mdash;”<br />
Then in Plexippus' unsuspecting breast<br />
He plung'd his impious sword: nor suffer'd long<br />
Toxeus to doubt, who hesitating stood,<br />
Now vengeance brooding for his brother's fate,<br />
Now dreading for himself a like swift blow;<br />
Again he warms the weapon, reeking still<br />
Hot from Plexippus' bosom, in his blood.<br />

Was dry'd, and vengeance only fill'd her soul.<br />
A log there lay when Thestius' daughter groan'd<br />
In child-bed pangs; which on the greedy flames<br />
The triple sisters flung; and while their thumbs<br />
Twirl'd round the fatal thread, this was their song;&mdash;<br />
“O newly born! to thee and to this bough<br />
“Like date of life we give.”&mdash;Then ceas'd their words,<br />
And from her presence vanish'd: sudden snatch'd<br />
The mother from the fire the burning brand,<br />
And quench'd it instant in unsparing streams.<br />
Long in most secret darkness had she hid<br />
This fatal wood; and, thus preserv'd, her son<br />
Had safely years mature attain'd; but now<br />
Forth she produc'd it from its close recess.<br />
Fragments of torches on the hearth she heap'd,<br />
And blew the sparklings into deadly flames;<br />
And thrice she rais'd her hands the branch to heave<br />
On the fierce fire; and thrice her hands withdrew.<br />
Sister and mother in one bosom fought,<br />
To adverse acts impelling. Oft her face,<br />
<a name="page_2_27"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
Dread of her meditated crime, bleach'd pale;<br />
Oft to her eyes her furious rage supply'd<br />
A fiery redness; now her countenance glow'd<br />
With threatenings cruel; now her softening looks<br />
To pity seemed to melt; and when fierce ire<br />
Had fill'd her soul, and parch'd up every tear,<br />
Fresh tears would gush. Thus rocks a vessel, driven<br />
By winds and adverse currents, both their force<br />
At once obeys, and can to neither yield.<br />
Thus waver'd Thestius' daughter, dubious thus<br />
Affection sway'd her; now her rage is calm,<br />
Now her calm'd rage with fourfold fury burns.<br />
At length the sister's o'er the parent's tie<br />
The prevalence obtains; impiously good,<br />
With blood her own, she soothes the brethren's shades.<br />
Now, when the fires destructive fiercely glar'd,<br />
She cry'd:&mdash;“Here, funeral pile, my bowels burn!&mdash;”<br />
And as the fatal wood her direful hand<br />
Held forth, the hapless mother, at the pyre<br />
Sepulchral, stood, exclaiming;&mdash;“Furies three!<br />
“Avenging sisters! hither turn your eyes;<br />
“Behold the furious sacred rites I pay:<br />
“For retribution I commit this crime.<br />
“By death their death must be aveng'd; his fault<br />

“Unpunish'd shall he 'scape then? Victor live,<br />

“Is then the mother's soul, the pious prayers<br />
“A parent should prefer? Where the strong pains<br />

“Would I had not then snatch'd thee from thy fate!<br />
“Thy gift of life is mine; now that thou dy'st<br />
“Thy own demerits ask: take the reward<br />

“What will my soul determine? Now mine eyes<br />
“The mangled corses of my brethren fill:<br />
“Now filial fondness, and a mother's name<br />
“Distract my soul. O, wretched, wretched me!<br />
“Brothers you gain the conquest, yet you gain<br />
“Dearly for me; but on your shades I'll wait,<br />
“Blest in what gives you once to me again.”<br />
She said; with face averse and trembling hand,<br />
The fateful brand amid the fires was dropt.<br />
The brand a groan deep utter'd, or a groan<br />
To utter seem'd: the flames half backward caught<br />
At length their prey, which gradually consum'd.<br />

Magnanimous he bore. Yet deep he mourn'd<br />
By such a slothful bloodless fate to fall;<br />
And happy call'd Ancæus in his wounds.<br />
With deep-drawn groans he calls his aged sire,<br />
His brother, sisters, and the nymph belov'd,<br />

Stretch'd on the earth the wretched sire defiles<br />
His hoary locks, and aged face with dust,<br />
Cursing his lengthen'd years: the conscious hand<br />

Justly to paint. Heedless of beauteous forms<br />
They beat their bosoms livid; while the corse<br />
Remains, they clasp and cherish in their arms<br />
The senseless mass; the corse they kiss, and kiss<br />
The couch on which it rests: to ashes burn'd,<br />
Careful collected in the urn, they hug<br />
Those ashes to their breasts; and prostrate thrown<br />

He cry'd,&mdash;“here shelter, enter 'neath my roof,<br />

“To rest is safer, till their wonted banks<br />

“A region stretches on th' extremest bounds<br />
“Of icy Scythia; dreary seems the place;<br />
“Sterile the soil; nor trees, nor fruits are seen;<br />
“But sluggish cold, and pale affright, and fear:<br />
“Still-craving Famine, there her dwelling holds.<br />
“Bid her within the inmost vitals hide<br />
“Of this most daring, and most impious wretch.<br />
“The proudest plenty shall not make her yield:<br />
“For in the contest, all the power I boast<br />
“To her shall stoop: nor let the lengthen'd way<br />

“My dragons; through the air their course direct<br />
“By these long reins.&mdash;Speaking, the reins she gave.<br />
“She, borne through ether in the granted car,<br />
“To Scythia's realm is carried: on the ridge<br />
“A rugged mountain offer'd, first she eas'd<br />
“The dragons' necks; as Caucasus 'twas known.<br />
“There she the sought-for Famine soon espy'd,<br />
“Eagerly searching on the stony fields,<br />
“At once with teeth and fangs, for thin-sown herbs.<br />
“Rough matted were her locks; deep sunk her eyes;<br />
<a name="page_2_44"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;44]</span>
“Pale bleach'd her face; her lips with whiten'd slime<br />
“O'erspread; with furry crust her mouth was rough:<br />
“Hard was her skin; and through it might be seen<br />
“Her inwards: 'bove her hollow loins, upstood<br />
“The arid bones: a belly's place supply'd<br />
“A belly's form: her breasts to hang appear'd<br />
“Held only by the chine: her fleshless shape<br />
“Each joint in bulk increas'd: rigidly large<br />
“The knees were swol'n, and each protruding part<br />
“Immod'rately was big. Then as the nymph<br />
“From far beheld her,&mdash;for a nigh approach<br />
“She dreaded, what the goddess bade she told.<br />
“Though brief her stay; though distant far she stood;<br />
“Though instant there arriv'd; she felt the power<br />
“Of Famine at the sight, and turning quick<br />
“Her reins, she urg'd her dragons to their speed<br />
“In retrogade direction; still on high,<br />
“Till Thessaly they gain'd. Famine performs<br />
“The wish of Ceres (though her anxious aim<br />
“Is still to thwart her power) and borne on winds<br />
“Swift through the air, the fated house she finds<br />
“And instant enters, where the inmost walls<br />
“The sacrilegious wretch inclose; in sleep<br />
“Deep bury'd, for night reign'd; and with her wings<br />
“Him clasping close, in all the man she breath'd<br />
“Her inspiration: in his throat, his mouth,<br />
“His chest, and in his unreplenish'd veins,<br />
<a name="page_2_45"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
“Her hunger she infus'd. The bidden deed<br />
“Complete, she vanish'd from those verdant fields,<br />
“And turn'd her to the needy roofs again,<br />
“And well-accustom'd caverns. Gentle sleep<br />
“Fann'd Erisichthon still with soothing wings.<br />
“Ev'n in his sleep imagin'd food he craves,<br />
“And vainly moves his mouth; tires jaw on jaw<br />
“With grinding; his deluded throat with stores<br />
“Impalpable he crams; the empty air<br />
“Greedy devouring, for more solid food.<br />
“But soon his slumbers vanish'd, then fierce rag'd<br />
“Insatiate hunger; ruling through his throat,<br />
“And ever-craving stomach. Instant he<br />
“Demands what produce, ocean, earth, and air<br />
“Can furnish: still of hunger he complains,<br />
“Before the full-spread tables: still he seeks<br />
“Victuals to heap on victuals. What might serve<br />
“A city's population, seems for him<br />
“Too scant; whose stomach when it loads had gorg'd,<br />
“For loads still crav'd. The ocean thus receives<br />
“From all earth's regions every stream; all streams<br />
“United, still requiring; greedy fire<br />
“On every offer'd aliment thus feeds,<br />
“Countless supplies of wood consuming;&mdash;more<br />
“Nutrition craving, still the more it gains;<br />
“More greedy growing from its large increase.<br />

“All food but stimulates his gust for food<br />

“In the deep abyss of his stomach huge,<br />
“Were all the riches which his sire's bequest<br />
“Had given: the direful torment still remain'd<br />
“In undiminish'd strength; his belly's fire<br />
“Implacable still rag'd. Exhausted now<br />
“On the curst craving all his wealth was spent.<br />
“One daughter sole remaining; of a sire<br />
“Less impious, worthy: her the pauper sold.<br />
“Her free-born soul, a master's sway disclaim'd.<br />
“Her hands extending, to the neighbouring main,<br />
“O thou!&mdash;she cry'd&mdash;who gain'd my virgin spoil<br />

“She whom her master following close, had seen<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of Ægeus begs the cause to know<br />

“A mournful task, O, warrior! you impose;&mdash;<br />

“Of Jove, his sire, he boasts; and all the fame<br />
“His acts deserv'd; and stepdame's cruel laws<br />
“Final completed. I (who shameful thought<br />

“A king of floods behold me; floods which roll<br />
“With winding current through the land you sway;<br />
“A son in me accept, no stranger sent<br />
“From distant regions; of your country one,<br />
“Part of your rule. Let it not hurt my claim,<br />
“That Juno hates me not; that all the toil<br />
“Of slavish orders I have ne'er perform'd.<br />
“Alcmena was his mother, let him boast!<br />
“Jove is a sire but feign'd, or if one true,<br />

“Whilst I in fighting gain the palm, be thou<br />
“Victor in talking.&mdash;Furious on he rush'd.<br />
“So proudly boasting, to submit I scorn'd;<br />
“But stript my sea-green robe, my arms oppos'd,<br />
“And held my firm-clench'd hands before my breast;<br />
“For stout resistance every limb prepar'd,<br />
“To meet the fight. He in his hollow palms<br />
“The dust collecting, sprinkled me all o'er,<br />
“And then the yellow sand upon me threw.<br />
“Now on my neck he seizes; now he grasps<br />
“My slippery thighs: but only thinks to hold,<br />
“In every part assailing. Still secure<br />
“In bulk I stand, and he assails in vain.<br />
“Thus stands a rock, which waves with thundering roar<br />
“Surround; it stands unhurt in all its strength.<br />
“A little we recede, then rush again<br />
“To join the war: stoutly our ground we hold,<br />
“Steady resolv'd to yield not. Foot to foot<br />
“Fixt firm: I prone press with my ample breast,<br />
“And hand with hand, with forehead forehead joins.<br />
“So have I seen two mighty bulls contend,<br />
“When each the fairest heifer of the grove<br />
“Expects the arduous struggle to reward:<br />
“The herds behold and tremble, witless which<br />
“The powerful contest shall successful gain.<br />
“Thrice while I clasp'd him close, Alcides strove<br />
“To throw me from his breast, in vain,&mdash;the fourth<br />

“He shook me from him, and my clasping arms<br />
“Unloosing, instant turn'd me with his hand;<br />
“(Truth must I speak,) and heavy on my back<br />
“He hung. If credence may my words demand,<br />
“Nor seek I fame through tales of false deceit,<br />
“A mighty mountain on me seem'd to weigh:<br />
“Scarce were my arms, with trickling sweat bedew'd,<br />
“Loos'd from his grasp; scarce was my body freed<br />
“From his hard gripe, when panting hard for breath,<br />
“Ere I could strength regain, my throat he seiz'd.<br />
“Then on the earth my knee was press'd; my mouth<br />
“Then bit the sand. Inferior prov'd in strength,<br />
“To arts I next betook me. Slipp'd his hands<br />
“In form a long round serpent; while I roll'd<br />
“In winding spires my body; while I shook<br />
“My forked tongue with hisses dire, he laugh'd,<br />
“And mock'd my arts; exclaiming,&mdash;snakes to kill<br />
“I in my cradle knew; grant thou excel'st,<br />
“O, Acheloüs! others far in size,<br />
“What art thou mated with the Hydra's bulk?<br />
“He fertile from his wounds, his hundred heads<br />
“Ne'er felt diminish'd, for straightway his neck,<br />
“With two successors, brav'd the stroke again:<br />
“Yet him I vanquish'd with his branching heads<br />
“From blood produc'd: from every loss more stout,<br />
“Him prostrate I o'erthrew. What hope hast thou,<br />
“In form fallacious, who with borrow'd arms<br />

“Now threaten'st? whom a form precarious hides?<br />
“He said, and fast about my throat he squeez'd<br />
“His nervous fingers; choaking, hard I strove,<br />
“As pincer-like he press'd me, to unloose<br />
“From his tight grasp my neck. Conquer'd in this,<br />
“Still a third shape, the furious bull remain'd:<br />
“Chang'd to a bull, again I wag'd the war.<br />
“Around my brawny neck his arms he threw<br />
“To left, and spite of every effort try'd<br />
“To 'scape, he dragg'd me down; the solid earth<br />
“Deep with my horn he pierc'd, and stretch'd me prone<br />
“On the wide sand. Unsated yet his rage,<br />
“His fierce hand seiz'd my stubborn horn, and broke<br />
“From my maim'd front the weapon. Naiäd nymphs<br />
“This consecrated, fill'd with fruits, and flowers<br />
“Of odorous fragrance, and the horn is priz'd<br />
“By Plenty's goddess as her favorite care.”<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke, a nymph close-girt like Dian's train,<br />
Her ample tresses o'er each shoulder spread,<br />
Enter'd, supporting all of Autumn's fruit<br />
In the rich horn, and mellowest apples came<br />
The second course to grace. Now day appear'd:<br />
The youths when light the loftiest summits touch'd<br />
Of the high hills, departed; waiting not<br />
Till the rough floods in peaceful channels flow'd;<br />
The troubled currents smooth'd. Profound his head<br />

With willow boughs and marshy reeds was hid.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou too, rash Nessus, through thy furious love,<br />
Of the same virgin, thy destruction met;<br />
Pierc'd through thy body with the feather'd dart!<br />
Jove's son returning to his natal soil,<br />
Companion'd by his new-made bride, approach'd<br />
Evenus' rapid flood. Swol'n was the stream<br />
With wintry showers as wont, and raging whirls<br />
Unfordable proclaim'd it; him, himself<br />
Fearless, yet anxious for his spouse's care,<br />
Nessus approach'd, in strength of limbs secure,<br />
And knowledge of the fords, and thus he spoke;<br />
“Her, O Alcides! will I safely bear<br />
“To yonder bank; thou all thy efforts use<br />
“In swimming.” Straight the Theban hero gives<br />
The pallid Calydonian to his care,<br />
Shivering with dread; no less the centaur frights<br />
Than the rough flood. The mighty warrior, prest<br />
With his large quiver, and the lion's hide,<br />
For on the bank opposing had he flung<br />
His club and curved bow, exclaim'd&mdash;“the stream<br />
“My arms will vanquish, soon as I essay.”&mdash;<br />
<a name="page_2_57"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;57]</span>
Nor dubious waits, but in the torrent leaps,<br />
Not heeding where most tranquil flows the stream,<br />
But stemming furious all its utmost rage.<br />
Now had he reach'd the bank, now held again<br />
The bow flung o'er, when loud his spouse's shrieks<br />
Assail'd his ear. To Nessus, whom he saw<br />
His trust about betraying, loud he cry'd;&mdash;<br />
“What vain reliance on thy rapid speed<br />
“Tempts thee to violence? O, double-shap'd!<br />
“I speak, regard me,&mdash;to respect my rights,<br />
“Should deference to me not move thee, think<br />
“How whirls thy sire, and that thy rage may check<br />
“For wishes unallow'd. Yet hope thou not<br />
“With courser's speed to 'scape me: with my dart,<br />
“Not feet, will I pursue thee.”&mdash;His last words<br />
With deeds he guarantees, and through and through<br />
The flying culprit felt the javelin driv'n;<br />
Out through his breast the forked weapon stood:<br />
Withdrawn, from either wound gush'd forth the gore,<br />
Mixt with the venom of Lernæa's pest.<br />
This be preserv'd.&mdash;“Nor will I unreveng'd<br />
“Expire,”&mdash;he murmur'd faintly to himself;<br />
And gave his raiment, in the warm blood dipt,<br />
A present to the nymph whose spoil he sought;<br />
To wake again her husband's dormant love.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long was the intermediate time, the deeds,<br />

Fill'd all the world meanwhile. Victor return'd<br />
From out &OElig;chalia, when the promis'd rites,<br />
To Jove Cænean, he prepar'd to pay,<br />
Tattling report, who joys in falshood mixt<br />
With circumstantial truth, and still the least<br />
Swells with her lies, had in thine ears instill'd,<br />
O Dejanira! that Alcmena's son,<br />
With Iölé was smitten. Ardent love<br />
Sway'd her belief, and terror-struck to hear<br />
Of this new flame, she melted into tears;<br />
With them her weeping grief first flow'd away:<br />
But soon she bursted forth.&mdash;“Why weep I so?<br />
“The harlot will but gladden in my tears!<br />
“But ere she here arrives, it me behoves<br />
“Each effort to employ, while time now serves,<br />
“To hinder what he seeks; whilst yet my couch<br />
“Another presses not. Shall I complain,<br />
“Or rest in silence? Shall I Calydon<br />

Determining last to send to him the robe,<br />
In Nessus' blood imbu'd, and so restore<br />
His waning love. Witless of what she sends,<br />
Herself to Lychas' unsuspecting hands<br />
The cause of future grief delivers. Wretch<br />
Most pitiable! she, with warm-coaxing words,<br />
Instructs the boy to bear her spouse the gift.<br />
Th' unwitting warrior takes it, and straight clothes<br />
His shoulders with Echidna's poisonous gore.<br />
Incense he sprinkles in the primal flames<br />
He kindles,&mdash;with the flames his prayers ascend.<br />
As from the goblet he the vintage pours<br />
On marble altars; hapless by the heat<br />
The poison more was quicken'd; by the flame<br />
Melted, it grew more potent; wide diffus'd,<br />
Through all the limbs of Hercules it spread.<br />
Still while he could, his fortitude, as wont<br />
His groans suppress'd; at last his patience spent,<br />
Fierce from the altar flinging, &OElig;té's mount<br />
So woody, with his plaintive shrieks he fills,<br />
And instant from his limbs the deadly robe<br />
Essays to tear: that, where he strips, the skin,<br />
Stript also, follows; dreadful to describe!<br />
Or to his limbs, his utmost struggling vain,<br />
It clings: or bare his lacerated joints<br />

Bedews his every limb; his scorch'd nerves crack;<br />
And whilst his marrow, with the latent pest,<br />
Runs fluid, high tow'rd heaven his arms he holds,<br />
Exclaiming;&mdash;“now Saturnia, feast thy soul<br />

Like a mad tiger, when the hunter's dart<br />
Stands in his body, and the wounder flies.<br />
Oft would you see him groaning; storming oft;<br />
Oft straining from his limbs again to fling<br />
The vest; trees rooting up; against the hills<br />
Fierce railing; next up to his father's skies<br />
His arms extending. Lo! he Lychas spies,<br />

In timid accents strove excuse to plead:<br />
Speaking, and round his knees prepar'd to cling,<br />
Alcides seiz'd him, with an engine's force<br />
Whirl'd round and round, and hurl'd him in the waves,<br />
Which by Eubæa roll. He, as he shot<br />
Through air, was harden'd. As the falling showers<br />
Concrete by freezing winds, whence snow is form'd:<br />
As snows by rolling, their soft bodies join,<br />
Conglomerating into solid hail:<br />
So ancient times believ'd, the boy thus flung,<br />
Through empty air, by strong Alcides' arm,<br />
Bloodless through fear, and all his moisture drain'd,<br />
Chang'd to a flinty rock. A rock e'en now<br />
High in Eubæa's gulph exalts its head,<br />
Which still of human form the marks retains.<br />
Which, as though still of consciousness possess'd,<br />
The sailors fear to tread, and Lychas call.<br />

Once more the realm of Troy; and through his aid<br />
The flames were plac'd below, whose greedy spires<br />
Seiz'd on the structure. On the woody top<br />
Thou laid'st the hide Nemæan, and thy head,<br />

Supported with thy club, with brow serene<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the strong fires spread wide o'er every part,<br />
Crackling, and seizing his regardless limbs,<br />
Who them despis'd. The gods beheld with fear<br />
The earth's avenger. Jove, who saw their care<br />
With joyous countenance, thus the powers address'd:<br />
“This fear, O deities! makes glad my heart;<br />
“And lively pleasure swells in all my breast,<br />
“That sire and sovereign o'er such grateful minds<br />
“I hold my sway; since to my offspring too<br />
“Your favoring care extends. No less, 'tis true,<br />

“But from your anxious breasts banish vain fear;<br />
“Despise those flames of &OElig;té; he who all<br />

“Nor shall the power of Vulcan ought consume,<br />
“Save his maternal part: what he deriv'd<br />
“From me, is ever-during; safe from death;<br />
“And never vanquish'd by the force of fire.<br />
“That we'll receive, his earthly race compleat,<br />
“Amidst the heavenly host; and all I trust<br />

“His great deserts demand it; and allow<br />
“Unwilling approbation.” All assent;<br />
Not even his royal spouse's forehead wore,<br />
A frown at ought he said; his final words<br />
Irk'd her at length, to be so plainly mark'd.<br />
Vulcan meantime each corruptible part<br />
Bore off in flames, nor could Alcides' form<br />
Remaining, now be known; nought he retain'd<br />
Of what his mother gave; Jove's share alone.<br />
A serpent revels thus in glittering scales,<br />
His age and former skin thrown off at once.<br />
So when Tirynthius from his mortal limbs<br />
Departed, in his better part he shone,<br />
Increas'd in stature; and majestic grace<br />
Augustly deck'd his venerable brow.<br />
Veil'd in a hollow cloud, and borne along<br />
By four swift steeds, in a high car, the sire<br />
Him plac'd in glory 'mid the radiant stars.<br />
Atlas perceiv'd his load increas'd. Nor yet<br />
Eurystheus 'bated in his rancorous hate,<br />

Mæander's daughter, whose recurving banks<br />
She often trode: (whose stream itself reseeks<br />
So oft) in beauteous form, by thee was known,<br />

Byblis and Caunus, from the warm embrace.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Byblis warn, that nymphs should ne'er indulge<br />
Illicit warmth. Her brother Byblis lov'd;<br />
Not as she ought; not with a sister's soul.<br />
No fires at first the maid suspected; nought<br />
Of sin: the thought that oft her lips to his<br />
She wish'd to join, and clasp her arms around<br />
His neck fraternal, long herself deceiv'd,<br />
Beneath the semblance of a duteous love.<br />
Love gradual bends to him her soul; she comes<br />
Fully adorn'd to see him, anxious pants<br />
Beauteous to seem; if one more beauteous there<br />
She sees, invidious she that face beholds.<br />
Still to herself unconscious was her love:<br />
No wish she form'd beneath that burning flame,<br />

Now kindred's name detesting; anxious more,<br />
Byblis, than sister he should call her still.<br />
Yet waking, ne'er her soul durst entertain<br />
Lascivious wishes. When relax'd in sleep,<br />
Then the lov'd object oft her fancy saw;<br />
Oft seem'd her bosom to his bosom join'd:<br />
Yet blush'd she, tranc'd in sleep. Her slumbers fly,<br />
She lies awhile in silence, and revolves<br />
Her dream: and thus in doubting accents speaks;<br />
“Ah, wretch! what means this dream of silent night,<br />
“Which yet I oft would wish? Why have I known<br />
“This vision? Envy's eyes must own him fair,<br />

“Would that the gods had all in common given,<br />
“Save parents only. Thou in lofty birth<br />
“I would should me excel. O beauteous youth!<br />
“A mother whom thou'lt make I know not; I<br />

“How much more happy are th' immortal gods!<br />
“The gods embrace their sisters. Saturn clasps<br />
“Ops, join'd to him by blood; Ocean enjoys<br />
“His sister Tethys; and Olympus' king<br />
“His Juno. Gods peculiar laws possess.<br />
“Why seek I then celestial rites to bring<br />
“Diverse, with human ord'nance to compare?<br />
“Forbidden love shall from my breast be driv'n,<br />

“Love forces, and I can. If shame my lips<br />

These words her hesitating mind resolv'd,<br />
Rais'd on her side, supported by her arm.&mdash;<br />

Shame and audacious boldness in her face<br />
Are mingled. Sister, once her hand had wrote,<br />

“(Witness, ye gods! my truth) all to suppress,<br />
“And act with wiser conduct: hapless war<br />
“Long have I wag'd 'gainst Cupid's furious rule<br />
“More pressure have I borne, than what a maid<br />
“Could e'er be thought to bear. At length o'ercome,<br />
“And forc'd to yield, thy help I must implore<br />
“With trembling voice: thou only canst preserve,<br />
“Thou only canst the loving nymph destroy.<br />
“With thee the choice remains. No foe thus sues,<br />
“But one by nearest ties to thee conjoin'd,<br />

“With closest bands. Let aged seniors learn<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, and such the wavering of her breast,<br />
<a name="page_2_82"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;82]</span>
That, whilst the trial grieves her which she made,<br />
Farther to try she wishes; every bound<br />
O'erpassing; and, with luckless fate, her suit<br />
Still meets repulsion. He, when endless seem'd<br />
Her pressing, fled his country, and the crime;<br />
And in a foreign region rais'd new walls.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, daughter of Miletus, they report,<br />
Forsook thee all thy senses; then in truth<br />
Thou rent thy garments from thy breast; thy breast<br />
Thy furious hands hard smote. Now to the world<br />
Madly she raves; now to the world displays<br />
Her wish'd-for love, deny'd: all hope&mdash;despair!<br />
She too forsook her country, and the roof<br />
So hated; and the vagrant steps pursu'd<br />
Her flying brother trode. As Thracia's dames<br />
O, son of Semelé! thy Thyrsus shake<br />
When celebrating thy triennial rites,<br />
So did the Carian matrons, Byblis see<br />
Fly o'er the wide-spread fields, with shrieks and howls:<br />
These left behind, o'er Caria's plains she runs,<br />
And through the warlike Leleges, and through<br />
The Lycian realms. Now Cragos had she left,<br />
And Lymiré, and Xanthus' waves behind;<br />
With the high ridge Chimæra lifts, who burns<br />
Central with flames; his breast and front fierce arm'd<br />
A lion&mdash;tow'rd his tail a serpent form'd.<br />
<a name="page_2_83"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;83]</span>
Now all the forests past; thou Byblis, faint<br />
With long pursuit, fall'st flat; on the hard ground<br />
Thy locks are spread; dumb now thou ly'st; thy face<br />
Presses the fallen leaves. Oft in their arms<br />
So delicate, the Lelegeïan nymphs<br />
To raise thee up attempted. Oft they strove<br />
To give advice that might thy love control,<br />
And offer solace to thy deafen'd ear.<br />
Still silent Byblis lies; and with her nails<br />
Rends the green herbage; moistens all the grass<br />
With rivulets of tears. And here, they say,<br />
The Naiäd nymphs their bubbling art supply'd.<br />
Ne'er drought to know: more to afford, their power<br />
Sure could not. Straightway, as the pitchy drops<br />
Flow from the fir's cleft bark; from solid earth<br />
As stiff bitumen oozes; or as streams,<br />
By cold congeal'd, thaw with the southern wind<br />
And warming sun: Ph&oelig;bean Byblis so<br />
By her own tears exhausted, was transform'd,<br />
A fount becoming; which still in that vale,<br />
'Neath a dark ilex springing, keeps her name.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now had the rumor of this wond'rous change<br />
Spread rapid through the hundred towns of Crete,<br />
But Crete had lately seen a wond'rous change<br />
In her own clime, in Iphis' alter'd form.<br />
There in the Phestian land, near Gnossus' realm<br />
<a name="page_2_84"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;84]</span>
Was Lygdus born: a man of unknown fame,<br />
But a plebeïan of unblemish'd worth:<br />
Nor had he, more than noble stock, estate;<br />
Yet unimpeach'd for honesty his life.<br />
He thus the ears of his then pregnant spouse<br />
Address'd, when near her bearing time approach'd:&mdash;<br />
“Two things my wishes bound; first that thy pains<br />
“May lightly press, next that a male thou bring'st:<br />
“More burdensome are females; strength to them<br />
“Nature denies. Then if by fate ordain'd<br />
“To give a female birth, which I detest,<br />
“Unwilling I command,&mdash;O piety!<br />
“Excuse it,&mdash;let the babe to death be given.”&mdash;<br />
He said, and tears profuse the cheeks bedew<br />
Of him who bade, and her who heard his words.<br />
Still Telethusa to the latest hour,<br />
With vain petitions strives her spouse to move,<br />
That thus he should not straighten so his hopes.<br />
Firm to his purpose Lygdus stood. And now<br />
Scarce could the heavy weight her womb sustain;<br />
When in the silent space of night, in sleep<br />
Entranc'd; or Isis stood before her bed,<br />
Or seem'd to stand; surrounded by the pomp<br />
To her belonging. On her forehead shone<br />
The lunar horns, and yellow wheat them bound<br />
In golden radiance, with a regal crown.<br />
With her Anubis, barker came; and came<br />
<a name="page_2_85"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;85]</span>
Bubastis holy; Apis various-mark'd;<br />
He who the voice suppresses, and directs<br />
To silence with his finger; timbrels loud;<br />
Osiris never sought enough; and snakes<br />
Of foreign lands full of somniferous gall.<br />
To her the goddess thus, as rais'd from sleep<br />
She seem'd, and manifest each object stood:&mdash;<br />
“O vot'ry, Telethusa! fling aside<br />
“Thy weighty cares; thy husband's mandates cheat;<br />
“Nor waver, when Lucina helps thy pains:<br />
“Save it whate'er it be. A goddess I,<br />
“Assisting, still give aid when rightly claim'd:<br />
“Nor will it e'er thee grieve to have ador'd<br />
“An ingrate goddess.”&mdash;Thus as she advis'd,<br />
She vanish'd from the bed. The Cretan dame<br />
Rose from the couch o'erjoy'd; and raising high<br />
To heaven her guiltless hands, pray'd that her dream<br />
On truth was founded. Now her pains increas'd;<br />
And now her burthen forc'd itself to air:<br />
A daughter came, but to the sire unknown.<br />
The mother bade them rear it as a boy,<br />
And all a boy believ'd it; none the truth,<br />
The nurse excepted, knew. Glad prayers the sire<br />
Offers, and from its grandsire is it nam'd:<br />
(Iphis, the grandsire's appellation.) Joy'd<br />
The mother hears the name, which either sex<br />
May claim; and none, in that at least, deceiv'd;<br />
<a name="page_2_86"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;86]</span>
The lie lay hid beneath a pious fraud.<br />
The robes were masculine, the face was such<br />
As beauteous boy, or beauteous girl might own.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now three annual suns the tenth had pass'd,<br />
Thy father, Iphis, had to thee betroth'd<br />
Iänthé, yellow-hair'd; nymph most admir'd<br />
'Mongst all the Phestians, for her beauteous charms:<br />
Telestes of Dictæa was her sire.<br />
Equal in age, and equal in fair form;<br />
The self-same masters taught the early arts,<br />
Suiting their years. Their unsuspecting minds<br />
Were both by love thus touch'd, in both was fix'd<br />
An equal wound: but far unlike their hopes.<br />
Iänthé, for a spouse impatient looks,<br />
With nuptial torches. Whom a man she thinks,<br />
That spouse she hopes will be. Iphis too loves,<br />
Despairing what she loves e'er to enjoy:<br />
This still the more her love augments, and burns<br />
A virgin for a virgin. Scarce from tears<br />
Refraining;&mdash;“What,”&mdash;she cries,&mdash;“for me remains?<br />
“What will the issue be? What cure for this<br />
“New love, unknown to all, who prodigies<br />
“Possess in this desire? If the high gods<br />
“Me wish to spare, straight should they me destroy.<br />
“Yet would they me destroy, they should have given<br />

“Love for an heifer ne'er an heifer moves;<br />
“Nor burns the mare for mares: rams follow ewes;<br />
“The stag pursues his female; birds thus join:<br />

“Not fix? Why Iphis thus thyself forget,<br />
“These stupid wishes driving hence, and thoughts<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here staid her speech; nor less the other nymph<br />
Burn'd; and O, Hymen, pray'd thy quick approach.<br />
But what she wishes Telethusa dreads,<br />
And searches for delays; feign'd sickness oft<br />
Prolongs the time; oft omens dire, and dreams.<br />
Now all her artful fictions are consum'd;<br />
And now the long protracted period came,<br />
For nuptial rites; and, but one day remain'd.<br />
She from her own and daughter's head unbinds<br />
The fillets; and with locks dishevell'd, clasps<br />
The altar, crying;&mdash;“Isis, thou who dwell'st<br />

“Thee, goddess, once I saw; and with thee all<br />

The lunar horns blaz'd bright; the timbrels rung.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth goes the mother, of the omen glad,<br />

Increases; fiercer frowns his forehead wears:<br />
Shorten'd his uncomb'd locks: more vigor now<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thence Hymen, in his saffron vesture clad,<br />
Through the vast air departs; and seeks the land<br />
Ciconian; by the voice of Orpheus call'd<br />
Vainly. He came indeed, but with him brought<br />
No wonted gratulations, no glad face,<br />
Nor happy omen. And the torch he bore<br />
Crackled in hissing smoke; nor gather'd flame<br />
From whirling motion. Still more dire th' event<br />
Prov'd, than the presage. As the new-made bride,<br />
Attended by a train of Naïad nymphs,<br />
Rov'd through the grass, a serpent's fangs her heel<br />
<a name="page_2_94"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;94]</span>
Pierc'd, and she instant dy'd. Her, when long-mourn'd<br />
In upper air, the Rhodopeïan bard<br />
Ventur'd to seek in shades, and dar'd descend<br />
Through the Tænarian cave to Stygia's realms.<br />
'Mid shadowy crowds, and bury'd ghosts he goes,<br />
To Proserpine, and him who rules the shades<br />
With sway ungrateful. There he strikes the strings<br />
Responsive to his words, and this his song.&mdash;<br />
“Gods of this subterraneous world, where all<br />
“Of mortal origin must come, permit<br />
“That I the truth declare; no tedious tales<br />
“Of falshood will I tell. Here came I not<br />
“Your dusky Hell to view: nor to o'ercome<br />
“The triple-throated Medusæan beast<br />
“Snake-hair'd;&mdash;my wife alone my journey caus'd,<br />
“Whose heel a trampled serpent venom'd stung:<br />
“Snatch'd in her bloom of years. Much did I wish,<br />
“My loss to bear; nor ought forbore to strive;<br />
“But love o'ercame. Well do the upper gods<br />
“That deity confess. In doubt I stand<br />
“If here too he is known; but here I judge<br />
“His power is felt: the ancient rape, if true,<br />
“Proves love ev'n you first join'd. You I implore,<br />
“By all those regions fill'd with dread; by this<br />
“Chaos immense; your ample realm, all fill'd<br />
“With silence; once again the thread renew<br />
“Eurydicé too hasty lost. To you<br />
<a name="page_2_95"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;95]</span>
“We all belong; a little while we stay,<br />
“Then soon or late to one repose we haste:<br />
“All hither tend; this is our final home.<br />
“You hold o'er human kind a lengthen'd reign.<br />
“She too, when once her years mature are fill'd,<br />
“To you again, must by just right belong.<br />
“I then request her only as a loan:<br />
“But should the fates this favor me refuse,<br />
“Certain I'll ne'er return. Two deaths enjoy.”&mdash;<br />
The bloodless shadows wept as thus he sung,<br />
And struck the strings in concord with his words.<br />
Nor Tantalus at flying waters caught;<br />
Nor roll'd Ixion's wheel: the liver gnaw'd<br />
The birds not: rested on their empty urns<br />
The Belides: and Sisyphus, thou sat'st<br />
Upon thy stone. Nay fame declares, then first,<br />
Vanquish'd by song, the furies felt their cheeks<br />
Wetted with tears. Nor could the royal spouse,<br />
Nor he who rules deep darkness, him withstand<br />
Thus praying; and Eurydicé is call'd.<br />
Amid the recent dead she walk'd, and still<br />
Halted with tardy steps from her late wound.<br />
Her, when the bard of Thrace receiv'd, this law<br />
Receiv'd he also: that his eyes reverse<br />
He should not bend, till past Avernus' realms;<br />
Else he'd the granted favor useless find.<br />
In silence mute, through the steep path they climb<br />
<a name="page_2_96"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;96]</span>
Dark, difficult, and thick with pitchy mist;<br />
Nor far earth's surface wanted they to gain:<br />
The lover here, in dread lest she should stray,<br />
And anxious to behold, bent back his sight,<br />
And instant back she sunk. As forth his arms<br />
He stretch'd, to clasp expecting, and be clasp'd:<br />
Unhappy! nought but fleeting air he held.<br />
Twice dying, she can nought her spouse condemn;<br />
For how blame him because too much he lov'd?<br />
She gives her last farewel; which scarce his ears<br />
Receive, then sinks again to shades below.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orpheus, thus doubly of his spouse despoil'd,<br />
All stunn'd appear'd: not less than he who saw<br />
In wild affright the triple-headed dog,<br />
Chain'd by the midmost: fear him never fled,<br />
Till fled his former nature: sudden stone<br />
On all his body seizing. Or than he,<br />
Olenus, when the crime upon himself<br />
He took, and guilty wish'd to seem; with thee<br />
Hapless Lethæa, confident in charms.<br />
Once breast to breast you join'd, now join as stones,<br />
Which watery Ida bears. Beseeching vain,<br />
And wishing once again the stream to pass,<br />
The ferryman denies. Then on the bank<br />
In squalid guise he sate, nor tasted food<br />
For seven long days; his cares, and grieving soul,<br />
<a name="page_2_97"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;97]</span>
And tears were all the sustenance he knew.<br />
Cruel he call'd the gods of Erebus,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice had the sun the year completed, each<br />
By watery Pisces ended. Orpheus still<br />
Fled every female's love: or his deep woe<br />
Made him so cold; or faithful promise giv'n.<br />
Yet crowds there were, who wish'd the bard's embrace:<br />
And crowds with sorrow saw their love repuls'd.<br />
A hill there rose, and on its summit spread<br />
A wide extended plain, with herbage green:<br />
Shade to the place was wanting; hither came<br />
The heaven-born poet; seated him, and touch'd<br />
His sounding strings, and straight a shade approach'd.<br />
Nor wanted there Chaönian trees; nor groves<br />
Of poplars; nor the acorn's spacious leaves:<br />
The linden soft, the beech, the virgin bay,<br />
The brittle hazle, and spear-forming ash;<br />
The knotless fir; ilex with fruit low-bow'd;<br />
The genial plane; the maple various stain'd;<br />
Stream-loving willow; and the watery lote;<br />
Box of perpetual green; slight tamarisk;<br />
Two-teinted myrtle; and the laurustine<br />
With purple berries. Thou too, ivy, cam'st<br />
Hither with flexile feet: together flock'd<br />
<a name="page_2_98"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;98]</span>
Grape-bearing vines; and elms with vines entwin'd:<br />
Wild ash, and pitch tree; and arbutus, bent<br />
With loads of ruddy fruit; the pliant palm,<br />
Meed of the conqueror; the pine close bound<br />
About its boughs, but at its summit shagg'd:<br />
Dear to the mother of celestial powers,<br />
Since Atys Cybeleïan was transform'd,<br />
And in the trunk a rigid tree became.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In form pyramidal, amid the crowd,<br />
The cypress came; now tree, but once a boy;<br />
Dear to the god who rules the lyre's fine chords,<br />
And rules the bowstring. Once was known a stag<br />
Sacred to nymphs that own Carthæa's fields,<br />
Who bore upon his head a lofty shade<br />
From his wide-spreading horns; his horns bright shone<br />
With gold; his collar, with bright gems bedeck'd,<br />
Fell o'er his shoulders from his round neck hung;<br />
A silver boss, by slender reins control'd<br />
Mov'd o'er his brow; a brazen pair the same,<br />
Shone o'er his temples hanging from his ears:<br />
Devoid of fear, his nature's timid dread<br />
Relinquish'd, oft the houses would he seek;<br />
And oft would gently fondling stoop his neck,<br />
Heedless who strok'd him. Cyparissus, thou<br />
Beyond all others priz'd the sacred beast:<br />
Thou, fairest far amongst the Cæan youths.<br />
<a name="page_2_99"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;99]</span>
Thou to fresh pastures led'st the stag; to streams<br />
Of cooling fountains: oft his horns entwin'd<br />
With variegated garlands. Horseman-like<br />
Now on his back thou pressest; and now here,<br />
Now there, thou rul'st his soft jaws with the reins<br />
Of purple tinge. 'Twas once in mid-day heat,<br />
When burnt the bent claws of the sea-shore crab,<br />
In Sol's fierce vapor; on the grassy earth<br />
The weary stag repos'd his limbs, and drew<br />
Cool breezes from the trees umbrageous shades.<br />
Here the boy Cyparissus careless flung<br />
His painted dart, and fix'd it in his side.<br />
Who, when he from the cruel wound beheld<br />
Him dying, instant bent his mind to die.<br />
What consolation did not Ph&oelig;bus speak?<br />
Urging the loss far slighter grief deserv'd:<br />
Yet mourn'd he still, and from the gods supreme<br />
Begg'd this last gift, to latest times to mourn.<br />
His blood in constant tears exhausted, now<br />
His limbs a green hue take; his locks which late<br />
Hung o'er his snowy forehead, rough become<br />
In frightful bushiness; and hardening quick,<br />
Shoot up to heaven in form a slender spire.<br />
The mourning god, in grief exclaim'd&mdash;“By me<br />
“Bemoan'd, thou shalt with others always grieve;<br />

“Hippomenes o'ershoots her; all around<br />
“Applauses ring. She soon corrects delay,<br />

“And leaves again the youth behind. Again,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While thus the Thracian bard the forests drew,<br />
And rocks, and furious beasts with strains divine;&mdash;<br />
Behold the Thracian dames! their madden'd breasts<br />
Clad with the shaggy spoil of furious beasts,<br />
Espy'd him from an hillock's rising swell,<br />
As to his sounding strings he shap'd the song.<br />
When one, her tresses in the ruffling air<br />
Wild streaming, cry'd&mdash;“Lo! him who spurns our ties!”&mdash;<br />
And full her dart 'gainst the harmonious mouth<br />
Of Ph&oelig;bus' son she flung: entwisted round<br />
<a name="page_2_132"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;132]</span>
With leaves, a bruise without a wound appear'd.<br />
A stone another for a weapon seiz'd;<br />
The flying stone was even in air subdu'd<br />
By harmony and song; and at his feet<br />
Low fell, as suppliant for its daring fault.<br />
But now the tumult swells more furious,&mdash;bounds<br />
It knows not! mad Erinnys reigns around.<br />
Yet all their weapons had his music's power<br />
Soften'd; but clamor, Berecynthian horns,<br />
Drums, clappings, bacchanalian shouts, and howls,<br />
Drown'd the soft lyre. Then were the stones distain'd<br />
With silenc'd Orpheus' blood. The Bacchæ first<br />
Drove wide the crowding birds, the snakes, the beasts,<br />
In throngs collected by his tuneful voice;<br />
Glory of Orpheus' stage. From thence they turn'd<br />
Their gory hands on Orpheus, and around<br />
Cluster'd like fowls that in the day espy<br />
The bird of darkness. Then as in the morn<br />
The high-rais'd amphitheatre beholds<br />
The stag a prey to hounds; so they the bard<br />
Attack'd, and flung their Thyrsi twin'd with leaves;<br />
For different use first form'd. Those hurl huge clods:<br />
These branches torn from trees; and others stones.<br />
Lest to their fury arms were wanting, lo!<br />
A yoke of oxen with the ploughshare broke<br />
The ground, not distant far; with sinews there<br />
Of nervous strength, the husbandmen upturn'd<br />
<a name="page_2_133"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;133]</span>
The stubborn soil; with sweat producing fruit.<br />
These, when the troop they saw, affrighted fled,<br />
Quitting their instruments of toil. Their rakes,<br />
Their ponderous harrows, and their huge long spades,<br />
Were scatter'd left on the deserted field.<br />
These when their furious hands had seiz'd, and tore<br />
From the strong oxen's heads the threatening horns,<br />
Back they return'd to end the poet's fate;<br />
And sacrilegious, as he stretch'd his hands,<br />
They slaughter'd him! Then first in vain his words<br />
Were utter'd; nought could then his speech avail.<br />
Then, heavenly powers! his spirit was expell'd<br />
And breath'd in air, even through that mouth whose sound<br />
Hard rocks had heard, and wildest beasts had own'd.<br />
For thee, O Orpheus! mourn'd the feather'd tribe,<br />
And crowds of savage monsters; flinty rocks<br />
Bewail'd thee; forests, which thy tempting song<br />
So oft had caus'd to follow, wept; the trees,<br />
Shorn of their pride, bewail'd with falling leaves.<br />
Each stream, 'tis said, with flowing tears increas'd<br />
Its current. Naïad nymphs and Dryads wore<br />
Garments of sable tinge, with streaming hair.<br />
Wide scatter'd lie his limbs. His head and lyre<br />
Thou, Hebrus, dost receive; and while they glide,<br />
Wond'rous occurrence! down the floating stream,<br />
The lyre a mournful moan sends forth; the lips,<br />
Now lifeless, murmur plaintive; and the bank<br />
<a name="page_2_134"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;134]</span>
Echoes the lamentations. Borne along<br />
To ocean, now his native stream they leave,<br />
And reach Methymna on the Lesbian shore.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head, expos'd thus on the foreign sand,<br />
And locks still dropping with the watery wave,<br />
A snake approach'd. But Ph&oelig;bus gave his aid,<br />
And check'd the greedy bite; with open jaws<br />
The serpent rears in stone congeal'd, as then<br />
Widely he gap'd. The ghost from earth descends,<br />
And views the regions he had view'd before.<br />
Exploring through th' Elysian fields he meets<br />
His dear Eurydicé; with longing arms<br />
He clasps her. Here they walk, now side by side,<br />
With equal pace; now follows he, and now<br />
A little space precedes her: Orpheus there<br />
Back on Eurydicé in safety looks.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bacchus suffer'd not the heinous deed<br />
Unpunish'd to remain; griev'd that the bard<br />
Who sung his praises, thus was snatch'd away,<br />
He bound the Thracian matrons, who the crime<br />
Had perpetrated, fast by twisted roots<br />
To earth as trees. He stretch'd their feet and toes,<br />
Which follow'd him so swift, and struck their points<br />
Deep in the solid earth: A bird ensnar'd<br />
Thus finds his leg imprison'd by the wires<br />
<a name="page_2_135"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;135]</span>
Hid by the crafty fowler, and his wings<br />
Beats, while his fluttering draws more tight the noose.<br />
So each, as firmly fixt to earth she stood,<br />
Affrighted strove to fly, but strove in vain:<br />
The flexile roots detain'd them; and fast ty'd,<br />
Spite of their struggling bounds, while they explore<br />
For toes and nails, and while they seek for feet,<br />
They see the wood their taper legs conceal;<br />
Their grieving hands to beat their thighs are rais'd;<br />
Their hands strike solid wood: their shoulders, breasts,<br />
Are also wood become. Their outstretch'd arms<br />
Extended boughs appear'd, and boughs they were.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor sated yet was Bacchus; all their fields<br />
He quits; attended by a worthier troop.<br />
To Tmolus' vineyards and Pactolus' stream<br />
He hies: the stream not yet for gold was fam'd;<br />
Not yet so precious were its envy'd sands.<br />
Satyrs and Bacchant' nymphs, his 'custom'd choir<br />
Attend him, but Silenus was not found.<br />
Him drunken had the rustic Phrygians seiz'd,<br />
Reeling with wine, and tottering 'neath his years;<br />
With ivy crown'd; and fetter'd to their king,<br />
The royal Midas, brought him. Midas once<br />
The Thracian Orpheus Bacchus' orgies taught,<br />
With sage Eumolpus; and at once he knew<br />
His old associate in the sacred rites;<br />
<a name="page_2_136"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;136]</span>
And joyful feasted with voluptuous fare,<br />
For twice five days, and twice five nights his guest.<br />
Th' eleventh time Phosphor' now the lofty host<br />
Of stars had chas'd from heaven; the jovial king<br />
Went forth to Lydia's fields, and there restor'd<br />
Silenus to the youth his foster-child.<br />
He, joy'd again his nursing sire to see,<br />
On him bestow'd his anxious sought desire,<br />
Though useless was the gift. Greedy he crav'd<br />
What only harm'd him,&mdash;saying&mdash;“Grant, O, power!<br />
“Whate'er I touch may straight to gold be chang'd”&mdash;<br />
Bacchus consents to what he wishes;&mdash;gives<br />
The hurtful gift; but grieves to see his mind<br />
No better wish demand. Joyful departs<br />
The Berecynthian monarch, with ill-fate<br />
Delighted; and, each object touching, tries<br />
The promis'd faith. Scarcely himself believ'd,<br />
When from a growing ilex down he tore<br />
A sprouting bough, straight gold the bough became:<br />
A stone from earth he lifted, pale the stone<br />
In gold appear'd: he touch'd a turfy clod,<br />
The clod quick harden'd with the potent touch:<br />
He pluck'd the ripen'd hoary ears of wheat,<br />
And golden shone the grain: he from the tree<br />
An apple snatch'd, the fam'd Hesperian fruit<br />
He seem'd to hold: where'er his fingers touch'd<br />
The lofty pillars, all the pillars shone:<br />
<a name="page_2_137"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;137]</span>
Nay, where his hands he in the waters lav'd,<br />
The waters flowing from his hands seem'd such<br />
As Danaë might deceive. Scarce can his breast<br />
His towering projects hold; all fancy'd gold.<br />
Th' attendant slaves before their master, joy'd<br />
At this great fortune, heap'd the table high<br />
With dainties; nor was bread deficient there:<br />
But when his hands the Cerealian boon<br />
Had touch'd, the Cerealian boon grew hard:<br />
And when the dainty food with greedy tooth<br />
He strove to eat, the dainty food grew bright,<br />
In glittering plates, where'er his teeth had touch'd.<br />
He mixt pure water with his patron's wine,<br />
And fluid gold adown his cheeks straight flow'd.<br />
With panic seiz'd, the new-found plague to view,<br />
Rich, yet most wretched; from his wealthy hoard<br />
Fain would he fly; and from his soul detests<br />
What late he anxious pray'd. The plenteous gold<br />
Abates his hunger nought, and parching thirst<br />
Burns in his throat. He well deserves the curse<br />
Caus'd by now-hated gold. Lifting his hands<br />
And splendid arms to heaven, he cries,&mdash;“O sire<br />
“Lenæan! pardon my offence: my fault<br />
“Is evident; but pity me, I pray,<br />
“And from me move this fair deceitful curse.”<br />
Bacchus, the gentlest of celestial powers,<br />
Reliev'd him, as he thus his error own'd:<br />
<a name="page_2_138"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;138]</span>
The compact first agreed dissolv'd, and void<br />
The grant became:&mdash;“Lest still thou shouldst remain<br />
“With gold”&mdash;he said,&mdash;“so madly wish'd, imbu'd,<br />
“Haste to the stream by mighty Sardis' town<br />
“Which flows; thy path along the mountain's ridge<br />
“Explore, opposing still the gliding waves,<br />
“Till thou the spring espy'st. Then deeply plunge<br />
“Beneath the foaming gush thy head, where full<br />
“It spouts its waters; and thy error cleanse,<br />
“As clean thy limbs thou washest.”&mdash;To the stream<br />
The king as bidden hastes. The golden charm<br />
Tinges the river; from the monarch's limbs<br />
It passes to the stream. And now the banks<br />
Harden in veins of gold to sight disclos'd;<br />
And the pale sands in glittering splendor shine.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detesting riches, now in woods he lives,<br />
And rural dales; with Pan, who still resorts<br />
To mountain caverns. Still his soul remains<br />
Stupidly dull; the folly of his breast<br />
Was doom'd to harm its owner as before.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High Tmolus rears with steep ascent his head,<br />
O'erlooking distant ocean; wide he spreads<br />
His bounds abrupt; confin'd by Sardis here,<br />
By small Hypæpé there. Upon his top,<br />
While Pan in boastful strain the tender nymphs<br />
<a name="page_2_139"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;139]</span>
Pleas'd with his notes, and on his wax-join'd reeds<br />
A paltry ditty play'd; boldly he dar'd<br />
To place his own above Apollo's song.<br />
The god to try th' unequal strife descends;<br />
Tmolus the umpire. On his mountain plac'd,<br />
The ancient judge from his attentive ears<br />
The branches clear'd; save that his azure head<br />
With oak was crown'd, and acorns dangling down<br />
His hollow temples grac'd. The shepherd's god<br />
Beholding,&mdash;“no delay, your judge,”&mdash;he said&mdash;<br />
“Shall cause,”&mdash;and straight Pan sounds the rural reeds.<br />
His barbarous music much the judgment pleas'd<br />
Of Midas, who amidst the crowd approach'd.<br />
Now venerable Tmolus on the face<br />
Of Ph&oelig;bus turn'd his eyes; and with him turn'd<br />
Th' attentive woods. Parnassian laurel bound<br />
His golden locks; deep dipt in Tyrian dye,<br />
His garment swept the ground; his left hand held<br />
The instrument with gems and ivory rich;<br />
The other grasp'd the bow: his posture shew'd<br />
The skilful master's art: lightly he touch'd<br />
The chords with thumb experienc'd. Justly charm'd<br />
With melody so sweet, Tmolus decreed<br />
The pipe of Pan to Ph&oelig;bus' lute should yield.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much did the judgment of the sacred hill,<br />
And much his sentence all delight, save one:<br />
<a name="page_2_140"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;140]</span>
For Midas blames him, and unjust declares<br />
The arbitration. Human shape no more<br />
The god permits his foolish ears to wear;<br />
But long extends them, and with hoary hairs<br />
Fills them within; and grants them power to move,<br />
From their foundation flexile. All beside<br />
Was man, one part felt his revenge alone;<br />
A slowly pacing asses ears he bears.<br />
His head, weigh'd heavy with his load of shame,<br />
He strove in purple turban to enfold;<br />
Thus his disgrace to hide. But when as wont<br />
His slave his hairs, unseemly lengthen'd, cropp'd,<br />
He saw the change; the tale he fear'd to tell,<br />
Of what he witness'd, though he anxious wish'd<br />
In public to proclaim it: yet to hold<br />
Sacred the trust surpass'd his power. He went<br />
Forth, and digg'd up the earth; with whispering voice<br />
There he imparted of his master's ears<br />
What he had seen; and murmur'd to the sod:<br />
But bury'd close the confidential words<br />
Beneath the turf again: then, all fill'd up,<br />
Silently he departed. From the spot<br />
Began a thick-grown tuft of trembling reeds<br />
To spring, which ripening with the year's full round,<br />
Betray'd their planter. By the light south wind<br />
When agitated, they the bury'd words<br />
Disclos'd, betraying what the monarch's ears.<br />

Latona's son, aveng'd, high Tmolus leaves,<br />
And cleaving liquid air, lights in the realm<br />
Laömedon commands: on the strait sea,<br />
Nephelian Hellé names, an altar stands<br />
Sacred to Panomphæan Jove, where seen<br />
Lofty Rhætæum rises to the left,<br />
Sigæum to the right. From thence he saw<br />
Laömedon, as first he toil'd to build<br />
The walls of infant Troy; with toil immense<br />
The undertaking in progression grew,<br />
And mighty sums he saw the work would ask.<br />
A mortal shape he takes; a mortal shape<br />
Clothes too the trident-bearing sire, who rules<br />
The swelling deep. The Phrygian monarch's walls<br />
They raise, a certain treasure for their toil<br />
Agreed on first. The work is finished. Base,<br />
The king disowns the compact, and his lies<br />
Perfidious, backs with perjury.&mdash;“Boast not<br />
“This treatment calmly borne,” the ocean's god<br />
Exclaim'd; and o'er the sordid Trojan's shores<br />
Pour'd all his flood of billows; and transform'd<br />
The land to sheets of water; swept away<br />
The tiller's treasure; bury'd all the meads.<br />
Nor sated with this ruin, he demands<br />
The monarch's daughter should be given a prey<br />
To an huge monster of the main; whom, chain'd<br />
To the hard rock, Alcides' arm set free,<br />
<a name="page_2_142"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;142]</span>
And claim'd the boon his due; the promis'd steeds.<br />
Refus'd the prize his valorous deed deserv'd,<br />
He sack'd the walls of doubly-perjur'd Troy,<br />
Nor thence did Telamon, whose powerful arm<br />
The hero aided, unrewarded go;<br />
Hesioné was by Alcides given.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peleus was famous for his goddess-spouse:<br />
Proud not more justly of his grandsire's fame,<br />
Than of his consort's father; numbers more<br />
Might boast them grandsons of imperial Jove;<br />
To him alone a goddess-bride belong'd.<br />
For aged Proteus had to Thetis said,&mdash;<br />
“O, goddess of the waves, a child conceive!<br />
“Thou shalt be mother of a youth, whose deeds<br />
“Will far the bravest of his sire's transcend:<br />
“And mightier than his sire's shall be his name.”<br />
Hence, lest the world than Jove a mightier god<br />
Should know, though Jove with amorous flames fierce burn'd,<br />
He shunn'd th' embraces of the watery dame:<br />
And bade his grandson Peleus to his hopes<br />
Succeed, and clasp the virgin in his arms.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hæmonia's coast a bay possesses, curv'd<br />
Like a bent bow; whose arms enclosing stretch<br />
Far in the sea; where if more deep the waves<br />
An haven would be form'd: the waters spread<br />
<a name="page_2_143"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;143]</span>
Just o'er the sand. Firm is the level shore;<br />
Such as would ne'er the race retard, nor hold<br />
The print of feet; no seaweed there was spread.<br />
Nigh sprung a grove of myrtle, cover'd thick<br />
With double-teinted berries: in the midst<br />
A cave appear'd, by art or nature form'd;<br />
But art most plain was seen. Here, Thetis! oft,<br />
Plac'd unattir'd on thy rein'd dolphin's back,<br />
Thou didst delight to come. There, as thou laid'st<br />
In slumbers bound, did Peleus on thee seize.<br />
And when his most endearing prayers were spurn'd,<br />
Force he prepar'd; both arms around thy neck<br />
Close clasp'd. And then to thy accustom'd arts,<br />
Of often-varied-form, hadst thou not fled,<br />
He might have prosper'd in his daring hope.<br />
But now a bird thou wert; the bird he held:<br />
Now an huge tree; Peleus the tree grasp'd firm:<br />
A spotted tiger then thy third-chang'd shape;<br />
Frighted at that, Æäcides his hold<br />
Quit from her body. Then the ocean powers<br />
He worshipp'd, pouring wine upon the waves,<br />
And bleating victims slew, and incense burn'd:<br />
Till from the gulf profound the prophet spoke<br />
Of Carpathus. “O, Peleus! gain thou shalt<br />
“The wish'd-for nuptials; only when she rests<br />
“In the cool cavern sleeping, thou with cords<br />
“And fetters strong her, unsuspecting, bind;<br />
<a name="page_2_144"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;144]</span>
“Nor let an hundred shapes thy soul deceive;<br />
“Still hold her fast whatever form she wears,<br />
“Till in her pristine looks she shines again.”<br />
This Proteus said, and plung'd his head beneath<br />
The waves, while scarce his final words were heard.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prone down the west was Titan speeding now;<br />
And to th' Hesperian waves his car inclin'd,<br />
When the fair Nereïd from the wide deep came,<br />
And sought her 'custom'd couch. Scarce Peleus seiz'd<br />
Her virgin limbs, when straight a thousand forms<br />
She try'd, till fast she saw her members ty'd;<br />
And her arms fetter'd close in every part:<br />
Then sigh'd, and said; “thou conquerest by some god:”<br />
And the fair form of Thetis was display'd.<br />
The hero clasp'd her, and his wishes gain'd;<br />
And great Achilles straight the nymph conceiv'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now blest was Peleus in his son and bride;<br />
And blest in all which can to man belong;<br />
Save in the crime of murder'd Phocus. Driven<br />
From his paternal home, of brother's blood<br />
Guilty, Trachinia's soil receiv'd him first.<br />
Here Ceÿx, Phosphor's offspring, who retain'd<br />
His father's splendor on his forehead, rul'd<br />
The land; which knew not bloodshed, knew not force.<br />
At that time gloomy, sad, himself unlike,<br />
<a name="page_2_145"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;145]</span>
He mourn'd a brother's loss. To him, fatigu'd<br />
With travel, and with care worn out, the son<br />
Of Æäcus arriv'd; and in the town<br />
Enter'd with followers few: the flocks and herds<br />
That journey'd with him, just without the walls,<br />
In a dark vale were left. When the first grant<br />
T'approach the monarch was obtain'd, he rais'd<br />
The olive in his suppliant hand; then told<br />
His name, and lineage, but his crime conceal'd.<br />
His cause of flight dissembling, next he beg'd,<br />
For him and his, some pastures and a town.<br />
Then thus Trachinia's king with friendly brow:<br />
“To all, the very meanest of mankind,<br />
“Are our possessions free; nor do I rule<br />
“A realm inhospitable: add to these<br />
“Inducements strong, thine own illustrious name,<br />
“And grandsire Jove. In praying lose not time.<br />
“Whate'er thou wouldst, thou shalt receive; and all,<br />
“Such as it is, with me most freely share;<br />
“Would it were better.” Speaking thus, he wept:<br />
His cause of grief to Peleus and his friends,<br />
Anxious enquiring, then the monarch told.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her words and tears the star-born husband mov'd;<br />
For less of love he felt not. Yet his scheme<br />
To voyage o'er the deep he could not change;<br />
Nor yet consent Alcyöné should share<br />
His peril: and with soothing soft replies,<br />
He try'd to calm her timid breast. Nor yet<br />
Himself approv'd the arguments he try'd,<br />
His consort to persuade consent to yield<br />
To his departure. This at length he adds<br />
As solace, which alone her bosom mov'd.<br />
“All absence tedious seems; but by the fires<br />
“My father bears, I swear, if fates permit,<br />
“Returning, thou shalt see me, ere the moon<br />
“Shall twice have fill'd her orb.” Hope in her breast<br />
Thus rais'd by promise of a quick return,<br />
Instant the vessel, from the dock drawn forth,<br />
He bids them launch in ocean, and complete<br />
In all her stores and tackling. This beheld<br />
Alcyöné; and, presaging again<br />
<a name="page_2_154"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;154]</span>
Woes of the future, trembled, and a flood<br />
Of tears again gush'd forth; again she clasp'd<br />
His neck; at length, as, wretched wife, she cry'd,&mdash;<br />
“Farewell” she, swooning, lifeless sunk to earth.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rowers now, while Ceÿx sought delays,<br />
To their strong breasts the double-ranking oars<br />
Drew back, and cleft with equal stroke the surge.<br />
Her humid eyes she rais'd, and first beheld<br />
Her husband standing on the crooked poop,<br />
Waving his hand as signal; she his sign<br />
Return'd. When farther from the land they shot,<br />
Her straining eyes no more indulg'd to know<br />
His features; still, while yet they could, her eyes<br />
Pursu'd the flying vessel. This at length<br />
Increasing distance her forbade to see;<br />
Still she perceiv'd the floating sails, which spread<br />
From the mast's loftiest summit. Sails at length<br />
Were also lost in distance: then she sought<br />
Anxious her widow'd chamber; and her limbs<br />
Threw on the couch. The bed, the vacant space,<br />
Renew'd her tears, reminding of her loss.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now far from port they'd sail'd, when the strong ropes<br />
The breeze began to strain; the rowers turn<br />
Their oars, and lash them to the vessel's side;<br />
Hoist to the mast's extremest height their yards;<br />
And loose their sails to catch the coming breeze.<br />
<a name="page_2_155"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;155]</span>
Scarce half, not more than half, the sea's extent<br />
The vessel now had plough'd; and either land<br />
Was distant far; when, as dim night approach'd,<br />
The sea seem'd foaming white with rising waves;<br />
And the strong East more furious 'gan to blow.<br />
Long had the master cry'd,&mdash;“Lower down your yards,<br />
“And close furl every sail!”&mdash;he bids; the storm<br />
Adverse, impedes the sound; the roaring waves<br />
Drown every voice in noise. Yet some, untold,<br />
Haste to secure the oars; part bind the sails;<br />
Part fortify the sides: this water laves,<br />
Ejecting seas on seas; that lowers the yards.<br />
While thus they toil unguided, rough the storm<br />
Increases; from each quarter furious winds<br />
Wage warfare, and with mounting billows join.<br />
Trembles the ruler of the bark, and owns<br />
His state; he knows not what he should command,<br />
Nor what forbid; so swift the sudden storm;<br />
So much more strong the tempest than his skill.<br />
Men clamorous shout; cords rattle; mighty waves<br />
Roar, on waves rushing; thunders roll through air;<br />
In billows mounts the ocean, and appears<br />
To meet the sky, and o'er the hanging clouds<br />
Sprinkles its foam. Now from the lowest depths,<br />
As yellow sands they turn, the billows shine;<br />
Now blacker seem they than the Stygian waves;<br />
Now flatten'd, all with spumy froth is spread.<br />
<a name="page_2_156"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;156]</span>
The ship Trachinian too, each rapid change<br />
In agitation heaves; now rais'd sublime<br />
The deepen'd vale she views as from a ridge<br />
So lofty: down to Acheron's low depths,<br />
Now in the hollow of the wave she falls,<br />
And views th' o'erhanging heaven from hell's deep gulf.<br />
Oft bursting on her side with loud report<br />
The billows sound; nor with less fury beat<br />
Than the balista, or huge battering ram,<br />
Driv'n on the tottering fort: or lions fierce,<br />
Whose strength and rage increasing with their speed,<br />
Rush on the armour'd breast and outstretch'd spear.<br />
So rush'd the waves with wind-propelling power<br />
High o'er the decks; and 'bove the rigging rose.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now shook the wedges; open rents appear'd,<br />
The pitchy covering gone, and wide-display'd,<br />
A passage opens to the deadly flood.<br />
Then from the breaking clouds fell torrent showers;<br />
All heaven seem'd sweeping down to swell the main;<br />
And the swol'n main, ascending to invade<br />
Celestial regions, soak'd with floods each sail:<br />
And ocean's briny waters mix'd with rain.<br />
No light the firmament possess'd, and night<br />
Frown'd blacker through the tempest. Lightning oft<br />
Reft the thick gloom, and gave a brilliant blaze;<br />
And while the lightnings flame the waters burn.<br />

At length his hope obtains, and singly keeps<br />
His post, by foes on every side assail'd:<br />
So when the furious billows raging beat<br />
The lofty side, the tenth impetuous rears<br />
Above the rest, and forceful rushes on;<br />
The battery ceasing not on the spent bark,<br />
Till o'er the wall, as of a captur'd town,<br />
Downward it rushes. Part without invade,<br />
And part are lodg'd within. In terror all<br />
In trembling panic stand: not more the crowd<br />
Which fill a city's walls, when foes without<br />
Mine their foundations; while an entrance gain'd<br />
Within, part rage already. Art no more<br />
Can aid; all courage droops; as many deaths<br />
Seem rapid rushing as the billows break.<br />
This wails in tears his fate; that stupid stands;<br />
This calls those blest whom funeral rites await:<br />
One to his deity rich offerings vows,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcyöné, alone in Ceÿx' soul<br />
Found place; and but Alcyöné, his lips<br />

To view once more his dear paternal shores;<br />
And turn his last looks tow'rd his regal dome:<br />
But where to turn he knows not; in a whirl<br />
So boils the sea; and all the heaven is hid<br />
In shade, by more than pitchy clouds produc'd:<br />
Night doubly darken'd. Now the whirlwind's force<br />
Shivers the mast, and tears the helm away:<br />
And like a victor, proud to view his spoils,<br />
Mounts an high wave, and scornfully beholds<br />
The lower billows; thundering down it sweeps,<br />
Impell'd by force that Athos might o'erturn,<br />
Or Pindus, from their roots; and plunge in sea.<br />
Down in the lowest depths, the weight and blow<br />
Bury'd the vessel; with her most the crew<br />
Sunk in the raging gulf: some met their fate,<br />
Ne'er to return to air: some floated still;<br />
To splinter'd fragments of the bark they clung.<br />
Ceÿx himself, grasp'd only in that hand<br />
A shatter'd plank, which once a sceptre held;<br />
And Æölus and Phosphor' call'd in vain:<br />
But chiefly from his lips was, as he swam,<br />
Alcyöné resounded; that lov'd name<br />
Remember'd constant, and repeated most.<br />

He prays the billows may his body bear<br />
To meet her eyes; and prays her friendly hands<br />
His burial may perform. While thus he swims,<br />
Alcyöné he names, whene'er the waves<br />
To gasp for breath permit him; and beneath<br />
The billows, tries Alcyöné to sound.<br />
Lo! a black towering arch of waters broke<br />
Midst of the surges; in the boiling foam<br />
Involv'd, o'erwhelm'd he sunk. That mournful night<br />
Was Phosphor' dark, impalpable to view:<br />
And since stern fate to heaven his post fast bound,<br />
He veil'd in densest clouds his grieving face.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime Alcyöné her height of woe<br />
Unknown, counts each sad night, and now with haste<br />
The garments he should wear prepares; and now<br />
Those to adorn herself when him she meets;<br />
Cherishing emptiest hopes of his return.<br />
Devoutest offerings to the heavenly powers<br />
She bore; but incense far before the rest<br />
On Juno's altar burn'd; and oft she pray'd<br />
For him who was not. For his safety pray'd;<br />
For his return; and that his love might still<br />
Without a rival hers remain: the last<br />
Of all her ardent prayers indulgence found.<br />
But longer bore the goddess not to hear<br />
Such vain petitions for the dead; these hands<br />
<a name="page_2_160"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;160]</span>
Polluted, from her altars to remove,<br />
To Iris thus she spoke:&mdash;“O, faithful maid!<br />
“Most trusty messenger, with speed repair<br />
“To Somnus' drowsy hall; him bid to send<br />
“A vision form'd in lifeless Ceÿx' shape<br />
“To tell Alcyöné her woes' extent.”<br />
She ended: in her various-teinted robe<br />
Attir'd, and spreading o'er the spacious heaven<br />
Her sweeping arch, Iris the dwelling sought<br />
The goddess order'd. Hid beneath a steep<br />
Near the Cimmerians, in a deep dug cave,<br />
Form'd in a hollow mountain, stands the hall<br />
And secret dwelling of inactive sleep;<br />
Where Ph&oelig;bus rising, or in mid-day height,<br />
Or setting-radiance, ne'er can dart his beams.<br />
Clouds with dim darkness mingled, from the ground<br />
Exhale, and twilight makes a doubtful day.<br />
The watchful bird, with crested head, ne'er calls<br />
Aurora with his song; no wakeful dog,<br />
Nor goose more wakeful, e'er the silence breaks;<br />
No savage beasts, no pastur'd flocks, no boughs<br />
Shook by the breeze; no brawl of human voice<br />
There sounds: but death-like silence reigns around.<br />
Yet from the rock's foundation, gently flows<br />
A stream of Lethe's water, whose dull waves<br />
In gentle murmuring o'er the pebbles purl,<br />
Tempting to slumber. At the cavern door<br />
<a name="page_2_161"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;161]</span>
The fruitful poppy, and ten thousand plants,<br />
From which moist night the drowsy juices drains,<br />
Then scatters o'er the shady earth, grew thick.<br />
Round all the house no gate was seen, which, turn'd<br />
On the dry hinge should creak; no centry strict<br />
The threshold to protect. But in the midst<br />
The lofty bed of ebon form'd, was plac'd.<br />
Black were the feathers; all the coverings black,<br />
And stretch'd at length the god was seen; his limbs<br />
With lassitude relax'd. Around him throng'd<br />
In every part, vain dreams, in various forms,<br />
In number more than what the harvest bears<br />
Of bearded grains; the woods of verdant leaves;<br />
Or shore of yellow sands. Here came the nymph;<br />
Th' opposing dreams push'd sideways with her hands,<br />
And through the sacred mansion from her robe<br />
Scatter'd refulgent light. With pain the god,<br />
His eyelids weigh'd with slothful torpor, rais'd;<br />
But at each effort down they sunk again:<br />
And on his breast his nodding chin still smote.<br />
At length he rous'd him from his drowsy state;<br />
And, on his elbow resting, ask'd the nymph,<br />
For well he knew her, why she thither came.<br />
Then she&mdash;“O Somnus! peaceful rest of all!<br />
“Somnus! most placid of immortal powers;<br />
“Calm of the soul; whom care for ever flies;<br />
“Who soothest bosoms, with diurnal toil<br />
<a name="page_2_162"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;162]</span>
“Fatigu'd; and renovat'st for toil again;<br />
“Dispatch a vision to Trachinia's town,<br />
“(By great Alcides founded,) in the form<br />
“Its hapless monarch bore: let it display<br />
“The lively image of her husband's wreck,<br />
“To sad Alcyöné. This Juno bids.”&mdash;<br />
Iris, her message thus deliver'd, turn'd:<br />
For more the soporific mist, which rose<br />
Around, she bore not; soon as sleep she felt<br />
Stealing upon her limbs, abrupt she fled,<br />
Mounting the bow by which she glided down.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drowsy sire, from 'midst a thousand sons,<br />
Calls Morpheus forth, an artful god, who well<br />
All shapes can feign. None copies else so close<br />
The bidden gait, the features, and the mode<br />
Of converse; vesture too the same he wears,<br />
And language such as most they wont to speak.<br />
Mankind alone he imitates. To seem<br />
Fierce beasts, and birds, and long-extended snakes<br />
Another claims: this Icelos the gods<br />
Have nam'd; by mortals as Photebor known.<br />
A third is Phantasus of different skill;<br />
His change is happiest when he earth becomes,<br />

By night to mighty heroes and to kings;<br />

The rest before th' ignobler crowd perform.<br />
All these the ancient Somnus pass'd, and chose<br />
Morpheus alone from all his brethren crowd,<br />
The deed Thaumantian Iris bade, to do;<br />
Then, weigh'd with slumber, dropp'd again his head,<br />
And shrunk once more within the sable couch.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flies through darkness on unrustling wings,<br />
And short the space, ere in Trachinia's town<br />
He lights; and from his shoulders lays aside<br />
His pinions; when he Ceÿx' form assumes.<br />
In Ceÿx' ghastly shape pallid he stood,<br />
Despoil'd of garments, at the widow'd bed<br />
Of the sad queen: soak'd was his beard, and streams<br />
Seem'd from his heavy dripping locks to flow.<br />
Then leaning o'er the couch, while gushing tears<br />
O'erspread his cheeks, he thus his wife bespoke;&mdash;<br />
“Know'st thou thy Ceÿx, wretched, wretched wife?<br />
“Or are my features chang'd by death? Again<br />
“View me, and here behold thy husband's shade,<br />
“Instead of husband: all thy pious prayers<br />
“For me, Alcyöné, were vain. I'm lost!<br />
“No more false hopes encourage, me to see.<br />
“The showery southwind, on th' Ægean main,<br />
“Seiz'd on our vessel, and with mighty blast<br />
“Shiver'd it wide in fragments; and the waves<br />
“Rush'd in my throat as loud thy name I call'd;<br />
<a name="page_2_164"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;164]</span>
“But call'd in vain. No doubtful author brings<br />
“To thee these tidings; no vague rumor this,<br />
“In person I relate it. Shipwreck'd I,<br />
“My fate to thee detail. Rise, and assist!<br />
“Pour forth thy tears; in sable garments clothe;<br />
“Nor send my ghost to wander undeplor'd,<br />
“In shady Tartarus.” Thus Morpheus spoke;<br />
And in such accents, that the queen, deceiv'd,<br />
Believ'd her husband spoke. Adown his cheeks<br />
Seem'd real tears to flow; and even his hand<br />
With Ceÿx' motion mov'd. Deeply she groan'd,<br />
Ev'n in her sleep, and rais'd her longing arms<br />
To clasp his body; empty air she clasp'd:<br />
Exclaiming;&mdash;“stay; O whither dost thou fly?<br />
“Together let us hence!”&mdash;Rous'd with the noise,<br />
And spectre of her spouse; sleep fled her eyes,<br />
And round she cast her gaze for that to seek<br />
Which she but now beheld. Wak'd by her voice,<br />
Her slaves approach'd with lights; but when in vain<br />
She search'd for what she lack'd, her face she struck;<br />
Rent from her breasts her garments; beat her breasts<br />
Themselves: nor stay'd her twisted hair to loose,<br />
But tore the bands away; then to her nurse<br />
Anxious the subject of her grief to learn&mdash;<br />
“Alcyöné,”&mdash;she cries&mdash;“is now no more!<br />
“She with her Ceÿx in one moment fell.<br />
“Hence with your soothing words; shipwreck'd he dy'd.<br />

“Yet had he not his wonted looks, nor shone<br />
“In former brightness his beloved face.<br />
“I saw him, hapless stand with pallid cheek,<br />
“Naked, with tresses dropping still. Lo! here<br />

Then anxious try'd his footmarks there to trace.&mdash;<br />
“This did my mind foreboding fear; I pray'd<br />
“When me thou fled'st, the winds thou would'st not trust:<br />
“But since to sure destruction forth thou went'st,<br />

“Allow'd not, yet shall name with name be seen.”&mdash;<br />
The rest by grief was chok'd, and sounding blows<br />
Each sentence interrupted; while deep groans<br />
Burst from her raving bosom. Morning shone,<br />
And forth she issu'd to the shore, and sought<br />
In grief the spot, where last his face she view'd<br />
Departing. “Here,”&mdash;she said,&mdash;“as slow he went,<br />
“As slow he loos'd his cables; on this beach<br />
“The parting kiss he gave.” While her mind's eye<br />
Retraces every circumstance, she looks,<br />
And something sees far floating on the waves,<br />
Not much unlike a man: dubious at first<br />
What it may be, she views it: nearer now<br />
The billows drive it; and though distant still,<br />
Plain to the eye a body was descry'd.<br />
Whose body, witless, still a shipwreck'd wretch<br />
With boding omen mov'd her; and in tears<br />
She wail'd him as a stranger in these plaints.&mdash;<br />
“Unhappy wretch! whoe'er thou art; and she<br />
“Thy wife, if wife thou had'st”&mdash;but now the surge<br />
More near the body bore. The more she views<br />
Nearer the corps; the more her senses fly.<br />
And now close driven to shore it floats, and now<br />
Well she discern'd it was, it was&mdash;her spouse!<br />
“'Tis he!”&mdash;she loudly shriek'd, and tore her face,<br />
Her hair, her garments. Then her trembling arms<br />
<a name="page_2_167"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;167]</span>
To Ceÿx stretching; “Dearest husband!”&mdash;cry'd.<br />
“Art thou restor'd thus to my wretched breast?”<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-rais'd by art, adjoining to the beach<br />
A mole was form'd, which broke the primal strength<br />
Of ocean's fury, and the fierce waves tir'd.<br />
Hither she sprung, and, wond'rous that she could!<br />
She flew; the light air winnowing with her wings<br />
New-sprung; a mournful bird she skimm'd along<br />
The water's surface. As she flies, her beak<br />
Slender and small, a creaking noise sends forth,<br />
Of mournful sound, and full of sad complaint.<br />
Soon as the silent bloodless corse she reach'd,<br />
Around his dear-lov'd limbs her wings she clasp'd,<br />
And gave cold kisses with her horny bill.<br />
If Ceÿx felt them, or his head was rais'd<br />
To meet her by the waves, th' unlearned doubt.<br />
But sure he felt them. Both at length, the gods<br />
Commisserating, chang'd to feather'd birds.<br />
The same their love remains, and subject still<br />
To the same fates; and in the plumag'd pair<br />
The nuptial bond is sacred; join'd in one<br />
Parents they soon become; and Halcyon sits<br />
Sev'n peaceful days 'mid winter's keenest rule<br />
Upon her floating nest. Safe then the main:<br />
For Æölus with watchful care the winds<br />

Guards, and prevents their egress; and the seas<br />
Smooths for the offspring, with a grandsire's care.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, as they skimm'd the surface of the main,<br />
An ancient sire beheld, and prais'd their love:<br />
Constant in death: his neighbour or himself<br />
Also repeats;&mdash;the bird which there you see,<br />
Brushing the ocean with his slender legs,<br />
(And shews a corm'rant with his spacious maw)<br />
A monarch's offspring was; would you descend<br />
Through the long series, 'till to him you reach;<br />
Ilus; Assaracus; and Ganymede,<br />
Borne up to heaven by Jove, supply'd the stock<br />
From whence he sprung; Laömedon the old;<br />
And Priam doom'd to end his days with Troy.<br />
Hector his brother; but in spring of youth<br />
He felt this strange adventure, he perchance<br />
As Hector's might have left a towering name:<br />
Though from old Dymas' daughter Hector sprung.<br />
Fair Alixirrhoë, so fame reports,<br />
Daughter of two-horn'd Granicus, brought forth,<br />
By stealth, Æsacus 'neath thick Ida's shade.<br />
Wall'd cities he detested; and remote<br />
From glittering palaces, secluded hills<br />
Inhabited, and unambitious plains;<br />
And scarce at Troy's assemblies e'er was seen.<br />
Yet had he not a clownish heart, nor breast<br />
<a name="page_2_169"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;169]</span>
To love impregnable. By chance he saw<br />
Cebrenus' daughter, fair Hesperië&mdash;oft<br />
By him through every shady wood pursu'd&mdash;<br />
As on her father's banks her tresses, spread<br />
Adown her back, in Ph&oelig;bus' rays she dry'd.<br />
The nymph, discover'd, fled. So rapid flies<br />
Th' affrighted stag to 'scape the tawny Wolf;<br />
Or duck, stream-loving, from the hawk, when caught,<br />
Far from her wonted lakes. The Trojan youth<br />
Quick follows, swift through hope; she swift through fear.<br />
Lo! in the herbage hid, her flying foot<br />
With crooked fang a serpent bit, and pour'd<br />
O'er all her limbs the poison: with her flight<br />
Her life was stopp'd. Frantic, he clasps her form<br />
Now lifeless, and exclaims&mdash;“how grieve I now,<br />
“That e'er I thee pursu'd; not this I fear'd!<br />
“How mean my conquest, bought at such a price!<br />
“Both, hapless nymph! in thy destruction join'd:<br />
“I gave the cause, the serpent but the wound.<br />
“I guiltier far than he, unless my death<br />
“Shall thine avenge.”&mdash;He said, and in the main,<br />
From an high rock, by hoarsely-roaring waves<br />
Deep-worn beneath, prepar'd to plunge. Receiv'd<br />
By pitying Tethys softly in his fall,<br />
She clothes him, as he swims the main, with wings;<br />
And death, so much desir'd, denies him still.<br />
The lover, furious at th' unwelcome gift<br />
<a name="page_2_170"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;170]</span>
Of life upon him forc'd, and his pent soul,<br />
Bent on escaping from its hated seat<br />
Confin'd, soon as the new-shot plumes he felt<br />
Spring from his shoulders, up he flew, and plunged<br />
Again his body in the depths below:<br />
His feathers broke his fall. Æsacus rav'd,<br />
And deeply div'd; with headlong fury still,<br />
And endless perseverance death he sought.<br />
Love keeps him meagre still; from joint to joint<br />
His legs still longer grow; his outstretch'd neck<br />
Is long; and distant far his head is plac'd.<br />
He loves the ocean, and the name he bears,<br />
From constant diving, seems correctly giv'n.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priam the sire, much mourn'd, to him unknown<br />
That still his son, on pinions borne, surviv'd:<br />
While Hector and his brethren round the tomb,<br />
A name alone possessing, empty rites<br />
Perform'd. Save Paris, from the solemn scene<br />
None absent were; he with the ravish'd wife<br />
Brought to his shores a long protracted war.<br />
Quick was he follow'd by confederate ships<br />
Ten hundred, and the whole Pelasgian race.<br />
Nor had their vengeance borne so long delay,<br />
<a name="page_2_174"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;174]</span>
But adverse raging tempests made the main<br />
Impassable; and on B&oelig;otia's shores,<br />
In Aulis' port th' impatient vessels bound.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, while the Greeks the rites of Jove prepare,<br />
Their country's custom, as the altar blaz'd,<br />
They saw an azure serpent writhe around<br />
A plane, which near the altar rear'd its boughs.<br />
Its lofty summit held a nest; within<br />
Eight callow birds were lodg'd; on these he seiz'd,<br />
And seiz'd the mother, who, with trembling wings,<br />
Hover'd around her loss, all burying deep<br />
Within his greedy maw. All stare with dread.<br />
But Thestor's son, prophetic truths who still<br />
Beheld, exclaim'd&mdash;“Rejoice! O Greeks, rejoice!<br />
“Conquest is ours, and lofty Troy must fall.<br />
“But great our toil, and tedious our delay.”<br />
Then shew'd the birds a nine years' war foretold.<br />
The snake, entwining 'mid the virid boughs,<br />
Hard stone becomes, but keeps his serpent's form.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still th' Aönian waves in violent swell<br />
Were lash'd by Neptune, nor their vessels bore;<br />
And many deem'd that Troy he wish'd to spare,<br />
Whose walls his labor rais'd. Not so the son<br />
Of Thestor thought: neither he knew hot so,<br />
Nor what he knew conceal'd:&mdash;a victim dire<br />
<a name="page_2_175"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;175]</span>
The virgin-goddess claim'd; a virgin's blood!<br />
When o'er affection public weal prevail'd,<br />
The king o'ercame the father; and before<br />
The altar Iphigenia stood, prepar'd<br />
Her spotless blood to shed, as tears gush'd forth<br />
Even from the sacrificial 'tendants. Then<br />
“Was Dian' mov'd, and threw before their sight<br />
A cloud opaque, and (so tradition tells)<br />
The maid Thycenian to an hind was chang'd,<br />
Amid the priests, the pious crowd and all<br />
Who deprecating heard her doom. This done,<br />
Dian' by such a sacrifice appeas'd<br />
As Dian' best became; and sooth'd her ire,<br />
The angry aspect of the seas was smooth'd;<br />
And all the thousand vessels felt the breeze<br />
Abaft, and bore the long impatient crowd<br />
To Phrygia's shores. A spot there lies, whose seat<br />
Midst of created space, 'twixt earth, and sea,<br />
And heavenly regions, on the confines rests<br />
Of the three-sever'd world; whence are beheld<br />
All objects and all actions though remote,<br />
And every sound by tending ears is heard.<br />
Here Fame resides; and in the loftiest towers<br />
Her dwelling chuses; and some thousand ways,<br />
And thousand portals to the dwelling makes:<br />
No portal clos'd with gates. By day, by night,<br />
Open they stand; of sounding brass all form'd;<br />
<a name="page_2_176"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;176]</span>
All echoing sound; all back the voice rebound:<br />
And all reit'rate every word they hear.<br />
No rest within, no silence there is found,<br />
Yet clamor is not, but a murmur low;<br />
Such as the billows wont to make when heard<br />
From far, or such as distant thunder sends,<br />
When Jove the dark clouds rends and drives aloof.<br />
Crowds fill the halls: the trifling vulgar come<br />
And issue forth. Ten thousand rumors vague<br />
With truth commingled to and fro are heard.<br />
Words in confusion fly. Amid the throng<br />
These preach their words to vacant air, and those<br />
To others tales narrate; the measure still<br />
Of every fiction in narration grows;<br />
And every author adds to what he hears.<br />
Here lives credulity; and here abides<br />
Rash error; transports vain; astonied fear;<br />
Sedition sudden; and, uncertain whence,<br />
Dark whisperings. Fame herself sits high aloft,<br />
And views what deeds in heaven, and earth, and sea<br />
Are done, and searches all creation round.<br />
The news she spreads, that now the Grecian barks<br />
Approach with valiant force; nor did the foe<br />
Unlook'd-for threat the realm. All Troy impedes<br />
Their landing, and the shores defends. Thou first,<br />
Protesilaüs! by great Hector's spear<br />
Unluckily wast slain. The war begun,<br />
<a name="page_2_177"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;177]</span>
Their valiant souls, ere yet they Hector knew,<br />
Dear cost the Greeks. Nor small the blood which flow'd<br />
From Phrygia's sons, by Grecia's valor spill'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now blush'd Sigæum's shores with spouting blood,<br />
Where Cygnus, Neptune's offspring, gave to death<br />
Whole crowds. Achilles in his chariot stood,<br />
And with his forceful Pelian spear o'erthrew<br />
Thick ranks of Trojans; and as through the fights<br />
Cygnus or Hector to engage he sought,<br />
Cygnus he met: delay'd was Hector's fate<br />
To the tenth year. Then to his white-neck'd steeds,<br />
Press'd by the yoke, with cheering shouts he spoke;<br />
And full against the foe his chariot drove.<br />
His quivering lance well-pois'd he shook, and call'd,<br />
“Whoe'er thou art, O youth! this comfort learn<br />
“In death, that by Achilles' arm thou dy'st.”<br />
Thus far Pelides; and his massive spear<br />
Close follow'd on his words. With truth it fled;<br />
Yet did the steely point, unerring hurl'd,<br />
Fall harmless: with a deaden'd point his breast<br />
Was struck. Then he;&mdash;“O goddess-born! (for fame<br />
“Thy race to me has long before made known)<br />
“Why wonder'st thou that I unwounded stand?”<br />
(For wondering stood Pelides.) “Not this helm,<br />
“Which thou behold'st, gay with the courser's mane.<br />
“Nor the curv'd buckler by my arm sustain'd,<br />
<a name="page_2_178"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;178]</span>
“For aid are worn. For comely grace alone<br />
“They deck me. Thus is Mars himself adorn'd.<br />
“Thrown every guard far from my limbs, my limbs<br />
“Unwounded would remain. Sure I may boast!<br />
“Sprung not from Nereus' daughter, but from him<br />
“Who rules o'er Nereus; o'er his daughter rules;<br />
“And all th' extent of ocean.” Cygnus spoke:<br />
And at Pelides launch'd his spear to pierce<br />
His orbed shield; its brazen front it pierc'd,<br />
And nine bull-hides beneath; stay'd at the tenth,<br />
The warrior shook it forth; with strenuous arm<br />
The quivering weapon hostile back return'd:<br />
Cygnus again unwounded felt the blow.<br />
Nor felt his naked bosom, to the force<br />
Of the third weapon vauntingly expos'd,<br />
Aught harm'd. Less fiercely in the Circus wide<br />
Rages the bull not, when the scarlet vests<br />
To urge his fury fixt, with furious horn<br />
To gore attempting, finds elusion still,<br />
The unhurt limbs invading. Seeks he now<br />
If fall'n the metal from his weapon's point:<br />
Fast to the wood the metal still appears;<br />
And cries he;&mdash;“Weak is then my hand? and spent<br />
“On one, is all the strength I once could boast?<br />
“For surely strength that arm could boast, which erst<br />
“Lyrnessus' wall o'erthrew, and when with gore<br />
“It Tenedos, and Thebes made stream; or when<br />
<a name="page_2_179"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;179]</span>
“Caÿcus purple flow'd, stain'd with their blood<br />
“Who on its banks had dwelt; and when twice prov'd<br />
“By Telephus, the virtue of my spear.<br />
“This nervous arm has here too shewn its force<br />
“In hills of slain by me up-heap'd; these shores<br />
“Attest it.” Speaking so, his spear he sent<br />
Against Men&oelig;tes 'mid the Lycian crowd,<br />
As doubting faintly deeds perform'd before:<br />
And pierc'd at once his corslet and his breast.<br />
From the hot smoking wound as forth he drew<br />
The dart,&mdash;as with his dying head was struck<br />
The solid ground, he spoke:&mdash;“This is the hand,<br />
“And this the spear which conquest knew before:<br />
“This will I 'gainst him use. May it, when sent,<br />
“The same success attend.”&mdash;Ere ceas'd his words<br />
Cygnus again with aim he sought, nor swerv'd<br />
His ashen weapon whence he aim'd, but rung,<br />
Unshrunk from, on the shoulder: thence repell'd,<br />
As from a wall or rugged rock it fell:<br />
Yet where the blow was felt, did Cygnus seem<br />
With blood distain'd. Achilles' joy was vain,<br />
For wound was not. Men&oelig;tes' blood was there.<br />
Then furious from his lofty car he sprung,<br />
And close at hand his braving foe assail'd<br />
With glittering falchion; by the falchion broke,<br />
The helm and shield he saw, but the keen edge<br />
His stubborn body blunted. More the son<br />
<a name="page_2_180"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;180]</span>
Of Peleus bore not, but the warrior's face<br />
With furious buffets from his shield, unclaspt<br />
First from his arm, he smote, and with his hilt<br />
Heavy his temples; and with headstrong rage<br />
Bore on him: nor to his astounded soul<br />
Respite allow'd. Dread through his bosom spread;<br />
Before his eyes swam darkness: when amidst<br />
The plain, a stone his retrogressive feet<br />
Oppos'd. Pelides, with his mightiest strength,<br />
Struck Cygnus against it, and to earth<br />
Hard forc'd him, thrown supine. Pent with his shield,<br />
And nervous knees upon his bosom prest<br />
Tight, he the lacing of the helmet drew,<br />
Which 'neath his chin was ty'd; close press'd his throat,<br />
His breathing passage and his life at once<br />
Destroy'd he. When his conquer'd foe to spoil<br />
Of all his arms he went, the arms he found<br />
Vacant. The ocean-god had to a bird<br />
Of snowy plumage chang'd his offspring's form:<br />
A bird which still the name of Cygnus bears.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here stay'd the toil, here did the battle gain<br />
Of numerous days a respite, either power<br />
Resting on arms unhostile. Then, while guards,<br />
Watchful, the Trojan walls protective kept;<br />
And sentries equal wakeful o'er the trench<br />
Form'd by the Argives watch'd, a feast was held,<br />
<a name="page_2_181"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;181]</span>
Where Cygnus' victor, stout Achilles, gave<br />
An heifer ribbon-bound to Athen's maid.<br />
The sever'd flesh was on the altar plac'd,<br />
Whose smoking fragrance, grateful to the gods,<br />
High to th' ethereal regions mounted. Part,<br />
Their due, th' official sacrificers took;<br />
To swell the feast the rest was given. Outstretch'd<br />
On couches, laid the noble guests, and fill'd<br />
With the drest meat their hunger; and with wine<br />
At once their thirst and all their cares assuag'd.<br />
No lyre them sooth'd; no sound of vocal song;<br />
Nor long extended boxen pipe with holes<br />
Multiferous pierc'd: but all night long, discourse<br />
Protracted; valiant deeds alone the theme.<br />
Alike the valiant acts their foes perform'd,<br />
And those their own they speak. Much they enjoy<br />
To tell by turns what hazards they o'ercame;<br />
And what they oft successless try'd. What else<br />
Could e'er Achilles' speech employ? What else<br />
By great Achilles could with joy be heard?<br />
Chief in the converse, was the conquest late<br />
O'er Cygnus gain'd, the topic. Strange to all<br />
Seem'd it; the youth, from every weapon safe<br />
By wound unconquerable, and with skin<br />
Blunting the keenest steel. Wonder the Greeks,<br />
And wonders ev'n Pelides: when in words<br />
Like these, old Nestor hail'd them. “Cygnus, proof<br />
<a name="page_2_182"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;182]</span>
“'Gainst steel,&mdash;unpierceable by furious blows<br />
“Your age alone has known. These eyes have seen<br />
“Perrhæbian Cæneus bear ten thousand strokes<br />
“Unhurt. He, fam'd for warlike actions, dwelt<br />
“On Othrys, and more strange those warlike deeds,<br />
“Since female was he born.” The wondering crowd,<br />
Mov'd with the novel prodigy, beseech<br />
(Their spokesman was Achilles) that the tale<br />
Nestor would give them. “Eloquent old man!<br />
“Of all our age most prudent, tell, for all<br />
“The same desire prevails o'er, who was he,<br />
“This Cæneus? why was chang'd his sex? what wars<br />
“Of fierce encounter made him known to thee?<br />
“And if by any conquer'd, tell the name.”<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thus the senior: “Though decrepid age<br />
“Weighs heavy on me, and the deeds beheld<br />
“In prime of youth, in numbers 'scape my mind;<br />
“Yet than those facts, 'mid all of peace and war,<br />
“Nought on my bosom made a deeper print.<br />
“Yet may extended age of all beheld<br />
“Part of the numerous acts and objects seen<br />

“Thou claim'st produc'd her. Nay, her nuptial couch,<br />
“Peleus perchance had sought, save that the rites<br />
“Already with thy mother were compleat,<br />
“Or were in promise ready. Nuptial couch<br />
“She never press'd, for on the lonely shore<br />
“Strolling, so fame declares, the vigorous clasp<br />
“Of Ocean's god she felt. The charms possest<br />
“Of his new object, Neptune said&mdash;whate'er<br />
“Thou wishest, chuse, secure of no repulse.&mdash;<br />
“This too does fame report, that Cænis cry'd&mdash;<br />
“Wrongs such as mine no trivial gift deserve,<br />
“That ne'er such shame again I suffer, grant<br />
“I woman be no longer; that will all<br />
“Favors comprize.&mdash;Her closing words betray'd<br />
“A graver sound; manly appear'd her voice:<br />
“And masculine it was. Deep ocean's god<br />
“Acceded to her wish, and granted, more,<br />
“That wounds should never harm her, nor by steel<br />
“Should she e'er fall. Joy'd at the gift, the god<br />
“Atracia's hero leaves&mdash;employs his age<br />
“In studies warlike; and among the fields,<br />
“Where fertilizing Peneus wanders, roams.<br />

<p class="nowrap">

Mount the black ashes, and conglob'd in one<br />
They thicken in a body, and a shape<br />
That body takes, and heat and light receives<br />

Much like a bird at first, and soon indeed<br />
A bird, its pinions sounded. And a crowd<br />
Of sister birds, their pinions sounded too;<br />

Their origin the same. Thrice they surround<br />
The pile, and thrice with noisy clang the air<br />
Resounds; the fourth time all the troop divide:<br />
Then two and two, they furious wage the war<br />
On either side; fierce with their crooked claws<br />
And beaks, they pounce their adversary's breast,<br />
And tire his wings. Each kindred body falls<br />
An offering to the ashes of the dead,<br />
And prove their offspring from a valiant man.<br />
These birds of sudden origin receive<br />
Their name, Memnonides, from him whose limbs<br />
Produc'd them. Oft as Sol through all his signs<br />
Has run, the battle they renew again,<br />
To perish at their parent-warrior's tomb.<br />
Thus, while all others Dymas' daughter weep<br />
In howling shape, Aurora still on griefs<br />
Her own sad brooding, her maternal tears<br />
Sprinkles in dew o'er all th' extent of earth.<br />

Phæäcia's neighbouring country, planted thick<br />
With grateful apples, now they reach; from thence<br />
Epirus and Buthrotus, by the seer<br />
Of Iliüm govern'd, image true of Troy.<br />
Thence of the future certain, full of faith,<br />
In all that Helenus of fate them told,<br />
Sicilia's isle they enter, which extends<br />
Midst of the waves its promontories three.<br />
Pachymos, tow'rd the showery south is plac'd;<br />

And Boreas' rugged storms, Pelorus looks.<br />
By this the Trojans steer; urg'd by their oars,<br />
And favoring tide, by night on Zanclé's beach<br />
The fleet is moor'd. Here Scylla on the right;<br />
Charybdis, restless, on the left alarms.<br />

Be feign'd not all, she had a virgin been.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her many wooers sought; these all repuls'd,<br />
She join'd the ocean nymphs; by ocean's nymphs<br />
Much favor'd was the maid; and told the loves<br />
Of all the baffled youths. Her, while she gave<br />
Her locks to comb, thus Galatea fair,<br />
Bespoke, but first suppress'd a rising sigh.<br />
“'Tis true, O maid! a gentle race thee seeks,<br />
“Whom safely, as thou dost, thou may'st deny:<br />
“But I, whose sire is Nereus; who was born<br />
“Of blue-hair'd Doris; who am potent too<br />
“In crowds of sisters, refuge only found<br />
“From the fierce Cyclops' love, in my own waves.”<br />
Tears chok'd her utterance here; which when the maid<br />
Had wip'd with marble fingers, and had sooth'd<br />
The goddess.&mdash;“Dearest Galatea! speak;<br />
“Nor from thy friend this cause of grief conceal:<br />
“Faithful am I to thee.” The goddess yields,<br />
And to Cratæis' daughter, thus replies.<br />

“With safety; spurner of the power of Jove,<br />

“Disturb'd by drenching showers; and soon this stream<br />
“Was clear'd to limpid purity. The rock<br />
“Gap'd wide, and living reeds sprung up erect,<br />
“On either brink. Loud roars the pressing flood<br />
“In the rock's hollow womb, and (wond'rous sight!)<br />
“A youth, his new-form'd horns with reeds begirt,<br />
“Sudden appear'd, 'mid waist above the waves;<br />
“Who but in stature larger, and his skin<br />

Swim o'er the placid waves. Scylla returns;<br />
Fearful to venture 'mid the boundless main,<br />
And vestless roams along the soaking sand;<br />
Or weary'd; finding some sequester'd pool,<br />
Cools in the shelter'd waters her fair limbs.<br />
Lo! Glaucus, lately of the mighty deep<br />
An 'habitant receiv'd, his shape transform'd<br />
Upon B&oelig;ötia's shores, cleaves through the waves;<br />
And feels desire as he the nymph beholds.<br />
All he can urge to stay her flight he tries;<br />
Yet still she flies him, swifter from her fear.<br />
She gains a mountain's summit, which the shore<br />
O'erhung. High to the main the lofty ridge<br />
An undivided sbrubless top presents,<br />
Down shelving to the sea. In safety here<br />
She stood; and, dubious monster he, or god,<br />
Admir'd his color, and the locks which spread<br />
Adown his shoulders, and his back below:<br />
And that a wreathing fish's form should end<br />
His figure from his groin. He saw her gaze;<br />
And on a neighbouring rock his elbow lean'd,<br />
As thus he spoke.&mdash;“No monstrous thing am I,<br />
“Fair virgin! nor a savage of the sea;<br />

“To the deep water, on the ocean I,<br />
“Still joy'd to labor. Now the following shoal<br />
“Of fishes in my net I dragg'd; and now,<br />
“Plac'd on a rock, I with my flexile rod<br />
“Guided the line. Bordering a verdant mead<br />
“A bank there lies, the waves its circuit bound<br />
“In part; in part the virid grass surrounds;<br />
“A mead which ne'er the horned herd had cropp'd:<br />
“Where ne'er the placid flock, nor hairy goats<br />
“Had brows'd; nor bees industrious cull'd the flowers<br />
“For sweets: no genial chaplets there were pluck'd<br />
“To grace the head; nor had the mower's arm<br />
“E'er spoil'd the crop. The first of mortals, I<br />
“On the turf rested. As my nets I dry'd;<br />
“And as my captur'd scaly prey to count,<br />
“Upon the grass I spread,&mdash;whatever the net<br />
“Escape prevented, and the hook had snar'd<br />
“Through their own folly. (Like a fiction sounds<br />
“The fact, but what avails to me to feign?)<br />
“Soon as the grass they touch, my captiv'd prey<br />
“Begin to move, and on their sides to turn;<br />
“And ply their fins on earth as in the main.<br />
“Then, while with wonder struck I pause, all fly<br />
“The shore in heaps, and their new master quit,<br />
“Their native waves regaining. I, surpriz'd,<br />
“Long doubtful stand to guess the wond'rous cause.<br />
“Whether some god, or but the grasses' juice<br />

“Can power like this possess?&mdash;and with my hand<br />
“Pluck'd up, and with my teeth the herbage chew'd.<br />
“Scarce had my throat th' untasted juice first try'd,<br />
“When all my entrails sudden tremblings shook,<br />
“And with a love of something yet unknown<br />
“My breast was mov'd; nor could I longer keep<br />
“My place.&mdash;O earth! where I shall ne'er return&mdash;<br />
“Farewel! I cry'd,&mdash;and plung'd below the waves.<br />
“Worthy the ocean deities me deem'd<br />
“To join their social troop, and anxious pray'd<br />
“To Tethys, and old Ocean, Tethys' spouse,<br />
“To purge whate'er of mortal I retain'd.<br />
“By them lustrated, and the potent song<br />
“Nine times repeated, earthly taints to cleanse,<br />
“They bade me 'neath an hundred gushing streams<br />
“To place my bosom. No delay I seek;<br />
“The floods from numerous fountains pour'd, the main<br />
“O'erwhelm'd my head. Thus far what deeds were done<br />
“My memory helps me to relate; thus far<br />
“Alone can I remember; all the rest<br />
“Dark to my memory seems. My sense restor'd,<br />
“I found my body chang'd in every part;<br />
“Nor was my mind the same. Then first I saw<br />
“This beard of dingy green, and these long locks<br />
“Which through the seas I sweep; these shoulders huge;<br />
“Those azure arms and thighs in fish-like form<br />

“Furnish'd with fins. But what avails this shape?<br />
“What that by all the deities marine<br />
“I dear am held? a deity myself?<br />
“If all these honors cannot touch thy breast.”<br />
These words he spoke, and more to speak prepar'd,<br />
When Scylla left the god. Repuls'd, he griev'd<br />
And sought Titanian Circé's monstrous court.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now had Eub&oelig;an Glaucus, who could cleave<br />
The surging sea, left Etna, o'er the breasts<br />
Of giants thrown, and left the Cyclops' fields,<br />
Unconscious of the plough's or harrow's use;<br />
And unindebted to the oxen yok'd.<br />
Zanclé he left, and its opposing shore<br />
Where Rhegium's turrets tower; and the strait sea<br />
For shipwreck fam'd, which by incroaching shores<br />
Press'd narrow, forms the separating bound<br />
Betwixt Ausonia's and Sicilia's land.<br />
<a name="page_2_258"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;258]</span>
Thence glides he swift along the Tyrrhene coast,<br />
By powerful arms impell'd, and gains the dome,<br />
And herbag'd hills of Circé Ph&oelig;bus sprung:<br />
(The dome with forms of wildest beasts full cramm'd)<br />
Whom, soon as greeting salutations pass'd,<br />
He thus address'd:&mdash;“O powerful goddess! grant<br />
“Thy pity to a god; and thou alone,<br />
“If worth that aid thou deem'st me, canst afford<br />
“Aid to my love. For, O Titanian maid!<br />
“To none the power of plants is better known<br />
“Than me, who by the power of plants was chang'd.<br />
“But lest the object of my lore, to thee<br />
“Unknown, be hid; I Scylla late beheld<br />
“Upon th' Italian shore: Messenia's walls<br />
“Opposing. Shame me hinders to relate<br />
“What promises, what prayers, what coaxing words<br />
“I us'd: my words all heard with proud contempt.<br />
“Do thou with magic lips thy charms repeat,<br />
“If power in charms abides: or if in herbs<br />
“More force is found, then use the well-try'd strength<br />
“Of herbs of power. I wish thee not to soothe<br />
“My heart; I wish thee not these wounds to cure;<br />
“Still may they last, let her such flames but feel.”<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Circé spoke, (and she a mind possess'd<br />
Most apt to flame with love, or in her frame<br />
The stimulus was plac'd; or Venus, irk'd<br />
<a name="page_2_259"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;259]</span>
At what her sire discover'd, caus'd the heat.)<br />
“O, better far the willing nymph pursue<br />
“Who would in wishes meet thee; wh'o is seiz'd<br />
“With equal love: well worthy of the maid<br />
“Thou wast; nay shouldst have been the first besought;<br />
“And if but hope thou wilt afford, believe<br />
“My words, thou shalt spontaneously be lov'd.<br />
“Fear not, but on thy beauteous form depend;<br />
“Lo! I, a goddess! of the splendid sun<br />
“A daughter, who with powerful spells so much<br />
“And herbs can do, to be thy consort sue.<br />
“Spurn her who spurns thee; her who thee desires<br />
“Desiring meet; and both at once avenge.”<br />
But to her tempting speeches Glaucus thus<br />
Reply'd&mdash;“The trees shall sooner in the waves<br />
“Spring up, and sea-weed on the mountain's top,<br />
“Than I, while Scylla lives, my love transfer.”<br />
The goddess swol'n with anger, since his form<br />
To harm 'twas given her not, and love deny'd,<br />
Turn'd on her happier rival all her rage.<br />
Irk'd at her slighted passion, straight she grinds<br />
Herbs infamous, to gain their horrid juice;<br />
And mixes all with Hecatéan spells.<br />
Then clothes her in a sable robe, and forth<br />
Through crouds of fawning savage beasts she goes,<br />
From her gay palace. Rhegium's coast she seeks<br />
O'erlooking Zanclé's rocks; and on the waves<br />
<a name="page_2_260"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;260]</span>
With fury boiling, steps; o'er them she walks<br />
As on a solid shore, and skims along<br />
The ridgy billows with unwetted feet.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little pool, bent in a gentle curve,<br />
With peaceful surface oft did Scylla tempt;<br />
And often thither she herself betook<br />
To 'scape from ocean's, and from Ph&oelig;bus' heat,<br />
When high in noon-tide fierceness short the shade<br />
Was from the head describ'd. Before she came<br />
The goddess poison'd all the pool; she pour'd<br />
Her potent juice, of monster-breeding power,<br />
Prest from pernicious roots, within the waves;<br />
And mutter'd thrice nine times with magic lips,<br />
In sounds scarce audible, her well-known spells.<br />
Here Scylla came, and waded to the waist;<br />
And straight, with barking monsters she espies<br />
Her womb deform'd: at first, of her own limbs<br />
Not dreaming they are part, she from them flies;<br />
And chides them thence, and fears their savage mouths.<br />
But what she flies she with her drags; she looks<br />
To find her thighs, and find her legs, and feet;<br />
But for those limbs Cerberean jaws are found.<br />
Furious the dogs still howl; on their fierce backs<br />
Her shorten'd groin, and swelling belly rest.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amorous Glaucus griev'd, and spurn'd the love<br />
<a name="page_2_261"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;261]</span>
Of Circé, who so rancorously had us'd<br />
The power of plants. Her station Scylla kept;<br />
And soon as scope for vengeance she perceiv'd,<br />
In hate to Circé, of his comrade crew<br />
Depriv'd Ulysses. Next the Trojan fleet<br />
Had she o'erwhelm'd; but ere they pass'd, transform'd<br />
To stone, she tower'd aloft a flinty rock,<br />
And still do mariners that rock avoid.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phrygian ships that danger 'scap'd, and 'scap'd<br />
Charybdis fell, by oars propell'd; but now<br />
Ausonia's shore well nigh attain'd, were driv'n<br />
By adverse tempests to the Libyan coast.<br />
Æneäs then the queen Sidonian took<br />
Most welcome to her bosom, and her dome;<br />
Nor bore her Phrygian spouse's sudden flight,<br />
With calm indifference: on a lofty pile<br />
Rear'd for pretended sacred rites, she stood,<br />

She all around outwitted. Flying far<br />
The new-rais'd city of the sandy plains<br />
To Eryx' country was he borne; where liv'd<br />
Acestes faithful: here he sacrific'd,<br />
And gave due honors to his father's tomb.<br />
Then loos'd his ships for sea, well nigh in flames<br />
By Juno's Iris: all th' Æoliän realm;<br />
The islands blazing with sulphuric fire;<br />

And rocks of Acheloüs' siren nymphs,<br />
He left. The vessel now, of him who rul'd<br />
The helm, bereft, along Ænaria's shore;<br />
And Prochytas; and Pithecusa, plac'd<br />
Upon a sterile hill, its name deriv'd<br />
From those who dwelt there, coasted. Erst the sire<br />
Of gods, detesting perjuries and fraud,<br />
Which that deceitful race so much employ'd,<br />
Chang'd to an animal deform'd their shapes;<br />
Where still a likeness and unlikeness seems<br />
To man. Their every limb contracted small;<br />
Their turn'd-up noses flatten'd from the brow;<br />
And ancient furrows plough'd adown their cheeks.<br />
Then sent them, all their bodies cover'd o'er<br />
With yellow hairs, this district to possess.<br />
Yet sent them not till of the power of speech<br />
Depriv'd; and tongue for direst falsehoods us'd:<br />
But left their chattering jaws the power to 'plain.<br />
These past, and left Parthenopé's high towers<br />
To right; and musical Misenus' tomb,<br />
And Cuma's shores to left; spots cover'd thick<br />
With marshy reeds, he enters in the cave<br />
Where dwelt the ancient Sybil; and in treats<br />
That through Avernus' darkness he may pass,<br />
His father's shade to seek. Then she, her eyes,<br />
Long firmly fixt on earth, uprais'd; and next,<br />

He ceas'd. O'erjoy'd, she grateful thanks returns;<br />

Numicius' waters 'midst a reedy shade<br />
Into the neighbouring main. She bids him cleanse<br />

And bear him silent floating to the sea.<br />
The horned god, what Venus bade perform'd:<br />
All that Æneäs had of mortal mould<br />

Capys before Capetus. After these<br />

Untry'd, by satyrs, by the wanton fawns,<br />

To gain her? These Vertumnus all excell'd<br />
In passion; but not happier he than they.<br />
How oft a basket of ripe grain he bore,<br />
Clad like a hardy reaper, and in form<br />
A real reaper seem'd! Oft with new hay<br />
His temples bound, who turns the fresh cut grass<br />
He might be thought. Oft in his horny hand<br />
He bears a goad; then might you swear, that now<br />
The weary oxen he had just unyok'd.<br />
Arm'd with a pruning hook, he one appears<br />
Who lops the vines. When he the ladder lifts,<br />
Apples about to pluck he seems. His sword<br />
Shews him a soldier; and his trembling reed<br />
An angler. Thus a thousand shapes he tries,<br />

Smok'd with the fiery sprinkling; and the gate,<br />
Op'd to the hardy Sabine troops in vain,<br />
Was by the new-sprung fountain guarded, 'till<br />
The sons of Mars had girt them in their arms.<br />
Soon Romulus attack'd them, and Rome's soil<br />
Was strew'd with Sabine bodies and her own:<br />
And impious weapons mingled blood of sires<br />
With blood of sons-in-law; yet so it pleas'd,<br />
<a name="page_2_296"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;296]</span>
War settled into peace, nor rag'd the steel<br />
To ultimate destruction; in the realm<br />
Tatius as equal sovereign was receiv'd.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tatius deceas'd, thou, Romulus, dispens'd,<br />
To the joint nations, equitable laws.<br />
When Mars, his helmet thrown aside, the sire<br />
Of gods and men, in words like these, address'd.&mdash;<br />
“O parent! (since the Roman realm has gain'd<br />
“A strong and wide foundation, nor should look<br />
“To one protector only) lo! the time<br />
“To grant the favor, promis'd me so long,<br />
“To thy deserving grandson. Snatch'd from earth<br />
“Let him in heaven he plac'd. Time was, long since,<br />
“In a full council of the gods thou said'st,<br />
“Well I remember, well my mindful breast<br />
“The tender words remark'd; a son of mine<br />
“By thee should in the azure sky be plac'd:<br />
“Now be the fulness of thy words complete.”<br />
Th' Omnipotent consented; with black clouds<br />
Darken'd the air; and frighten'd all the town<br />
With flaming thunders. When the martial god<br />
Perceiv'd this fiat of the promis'd change,<br />
Propp'd on his spear he fearless mounts the steeds,<br />
Press'd by the bloody yoke; loud sounds the lash,<br />
And prone the air he cleaves, lights on the top<br />
Of shady Palatine. There Ilia's son<br />
<a name="page_2_297"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;297]</span>
Delivering regal laws to Romans round,<br />
He saw, and swept him thence: his mortal limbs<br />
Waste in the empty air, as balls of lead<br />
Hurl'd from a sling, melt in the midmost sky:<br />
More fair his face appears, and worthy more<br />
Of the high shrines: such now appears the form<br />
Of great Quirinus, clad in purple robe.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spouse him wept as lost, when heaven's high queen<br />
Bade Iris on her sweeping bow descend,<br />
And thus her orders to Hersilia speak:&mdash;<br />
“O matron! glory of the Latian land;<br />
“Pride of the Sabine race; most worthy spouse<br />
“Of such an hero once; spouse worthy now<br />
“Of god Quirinus, cease thy tears: if wish<br />
“To see thy husband warms thee, led by me,<br />
“To yonder grove upon Quirinus' hill<br />
“Which flourishes, and overshades the fane<br />
“Of Rome's great monarch, haste.”&mdash;Iris obeys;<br />
Upon her painted bow to earth slides down,<br />
And hails Hersilia in the bidden words.<br />
Her eyes scarce lifting, she with blushing face<br />
Replies&mdash;“O goddess! whom thou art, to me<br />
“Unknown; that thou a goddess art is plain.<br />
“Lead me, O lead! shew me my spouse's face:<br />
“Which if fate grant I may once more behold,<br />
“Heaven I'll allow I've seen.” Nor waits she more,<br />
<a name="page_2_298"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;298]</span>
But with Thaumantian Iris, to the hill<br />
Of Romulus proceeds. There, shot from heaven,<br />
A star tow'rd earth descended; from its rays<br />
Bright flam'd Hersilia's hair, and with the star<br />
Mounted aloft. Rome's founder's well-known arms<br />
Receive her. Now her former name is chang'd,<br />
As chang'd her body: known as Ora, now,<br />
A goddess, with her great Quirinus join'd.<br />

Thus an old 'habitant, well vers'd in tales<br />
Of yore, reply'd.&mdash;“Jove's son, rich in the herds<br />
“Iberia bred, his prosperous journey bent<br />
“By ocean unto fair Lacinia's shores:<br />
“Enter'd himself the hospitable roof<br />
“Of mighty Croto, while his cattle' stray'd<br />
“Amid the tender grass; and his long toil<br />
“Reliev'd by rest. Departing, thus he spoke&mdash;<br />
“Here in thy grandson's age a town shall rise.&mdash;<br />
“And true the promis'd words; for Myscelos,<br />
“Argive Alemon's son, dear to the gods,<br />
“Beyond all mortals of that time, now liv'd.<br />
“The club-arm'd god, as press'd with heavy sleep,<br />
“He lay, hung o'er him, and directed thus.&mdash;<br />
“Haste leave thy native land;&mdash;where distant flows<br />
“The rocky stream of Æsaris, go seek.&mdash;<br />
“And threaten'd much if disobedient found:<br />
“Then disappear'd the god and sleep at once.<br />
“Alemon's son arose; with silent care<br />
“Revolv'd the new-seen vision in his soul,<br />
“And undetermin'd waver'd long his mind.<br />
“The god commands,&mdash;the laws forbid to go:<br />
“Death is the punishment to him decreed<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here dwelt a sage whom Samos claim'd by birth,<br />
But Samos and its masters he had fled;<br />
A willing exile from tyrannic rule.<br />
Though from celestial regions far remov'd<br />
His mind to heaven could soar; with mental eyes<br />
He things explor'd which to the human ken<br />
Nature deny'd. When all with watchful care<br />
Was learnt in secret, to the listening crowd<br />
He public spoke. Told to their wondering ears<br />
The primal origin of this great world;<br />
The cause of things; what nature is; what god;<br />
Whence snow; and whence tremendous thunder springs,&mdash;<br />
From Jove, or from the rattling of rent clouds;<br />
What shakes earth's pillars; by what law the stars<br />
Wander; and what besides lies hid from man.<br />
And first that animals should heap the board<br />

“Two, earth and water, which their ponderous weight<br />

“Void of dense gravity, soar up on high,<br />
“Free, unconfin'd. Though distant far in space,<br />
“Yet from these four are all things form'd, and all<br />
“To them resolve again. The earth dissolv'd<br />
“Melts into liquid dew; more subtile grown<br />

“It passes to the breezes and the air;<br />
“And air again, when in its thinest form,<br />
“Depriv'd of weight, springs to the fires on high.<br />
“Thence retrogade they come, inverting all<br />
“This order: fire is thicken'd to dense air;<br />
“Air into water; water to hard earth;<br />
“Nor aught retains its form. Nature, of things<br />
“Renewer, figures from old figures makes.<br />
“Nought that the world contains (doubt not my truth)<br />
“E'er perishes, but changes; and receives<br />
“An alter'd shape. What to be born we call,<br />
“Is to begin in different guise to seem<br />
“Than what we were; and what we call to die,<br />
“Is but to cease to wear our wonted form.<br />
“Though haply some part hither may be mov'd,<br />
“Some thither, still the aggregate's the same.<br />
“Nor can I think that aught can long endure<br />
“Unalter'd. Soon the primal ages came<br />
“From gold to iron. Quite transform'd is oft<br />
“The state of places. I have seen what once<br />
“Was earth most solid, chang'd to fluid waves.<br />
“Land have I seen from ocean form'd; and shells<br />
“Marine, lie scatter'd distant from all shore:<br />
“Old anchors bury'd in the mountain tops.<br />
“The rush of waters hollow vallies forms<br />
“Where once were plains; and level lie the hills<br />
“Beneath the deluge: dry the marshy ground<br />
<a name="page_2_314"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;314]</span>
“With barren sand becomes; and what was parch'd<br />
“Is soak'd, a marshy fen. Here nature opes<br />
“New fountains; there she closes up the old.<br />
“Rivers have bursted forth, when earthquakes shook<br />
“The globe; some chok'd have disappear'd below.<br />
“Thus Lycus, swallow'd by the yawning earth,<br />
“Bursts far from thence again, another stream:<br />
“The mighty Erasinus, now absorb'd,<br />
“Now flows, to Argive fields again restor'd.<br />
“And Myssus, they relate, who both his stream<br />
“And banks disliking, as Caïcus now<br />
“'Twixt others flows. With Amenane who rolls<br />
“O'er sands Sicilian, flowing oft, and oft<br />
“With clos'd-up fountains dry. Anigros, once<br />
“Sweet to the thirsty, now his waters pours<br />
“Untouch'd by lips, since (save we must deny<br />
“To poets faith) the double-body'd race<br />
“There bath'd the wounds Alcides' arrows gave.<br />
“And is not Hypanis, the flood that springs<br />
“From Scythia's hills, once sweet, with bitter salts<br />
“Now tainted? By the waves begirt were once<br />
“Antissa, Pharos, and Ph&oelig;nician Tyre;<br />
“And not a spot an island now remains.<br />
“The ancient clowns, Leucadia to the land<br />
“Saw join'd; now surges beat around its base;<br />
“And Zanclé, they relate, was once conjoin'd<br />
“To Italy, 'till ocean burst his bounds,<br />
<a name="page_2_315"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;315]</span>
“And rent the land, and girt it with his waves.<br />
“For Helicé or Buris should you seek,<br />
“Achaïan towns, o'erwhelm'd beneath the waves<br />
“You'll find them: boatmen oft are wont to shew<br />
“The tottering cities, and their walls immers'd.<br />
“Near Pitthean Tr&oelig;zen is a lofty hill<br />
“By trees unshaded; now indeed an hill<br />
“But once a level plain. Wond'rous to tell<br />
“The wind's resistless force, in caverns deep<br />
“Inclos'd, for exit somewhere as it strain'd,<br />
“And struggled long in vain, a freer range<br />
“Of air to sweep; when all the prison round<br />
“Was found no fissure pervious to the blast,<br />
“It swell'd the high-rais'd ground: just so the breath<br />
“Puffs out the bladder, or the horn'd goat's skin.<br />
“The tumor still remains, and now appears,<br />
“Grown hard by lapse of time, a lofty hill.<br />
“Though numbers to my mind occur, or seen<br />

But yet obscurely: till his piercing eye<br />
He from the entrails turn'd to Cippus' horns.<br />

“Enter; so fate commands. In them receiv'd<br />
“King wilt thou be; in safety wilt enjoy<br />

His feet, and from the city's walls he turn'd<br />
Sternly his looks; exclaiming; “far, ye gods!<br />
“O, far avert these omens! Better I<br />
“An exile roam for life, than monarch rule<br />
“The Capitol.” Then he assembled straight<br />

“Far from your city, will your monarch be;<br />
“By marks, but not by name I him describe:<br />
“Two horns his forehead bears. He is the man,<br />

“Expel him, Romans! from your city far;<br />
“Or, if he merit them, with massive chains<br />
“Load him: or rid yourself at once of fear<br />

'Mid lofty pines, when Eurus whistles fierce;<br />
Such is the roaring of the ocean waves<br />
Rolling far distant, as the crowd sent forth:<br />
Till from amidst the all-confounding noise<br />
One spoke more loud, and&mdash;“which is he?” exclaim'd.<br />
Then all the brows they search'd, the horns to find.<br />
Cippus again address'd them. “What you seek<br />

Spite of their efforts, and his forehead shew'd,<br />
With double horns distinguish'd. All their eyes<br />

The rites of Esculapius introduc'd<br />
Into the town of Romulus! A plague<br />
Of direst form infected Latium's air,<br />
And the pale bloodless bodies wasted thin<br />
Squalid in poison. When the numerous deaths<br />

Thrilling their fear-struck bosoms: “What you seek,<br />

What city's walls Apollo's son contain;<br />
Depute a band, whom favoring breezes waft<br />
To Epidaurus' shores. Soon as their keels<br />
Touch'd on the strand, they to th' assembled crowd<br />
Of Grecian elders haste; and earnest beg<br />
To grant their deity, to check the rage<br />
Of death amongst the hapless Latian race,<br />
By his mere presence. So unerring fate<br />
Had said. Divided is the council's voice:<br />
Some would the aid besought, be granted; some,<br />
And many, these oppose; refuse to send<br />
To foreign lands their patron, and their god.<br />
While dubious they deliberated, eve<br />
Chas'd the remains of light, and the earth's shade<br />
Threw darkness round; when, lo! the helping god<br />
Appear'd in sleep before the Roman's bed<br />
<a name="page_2_332"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;332]</span>
To stand, in form like what his temples grace.<br />
His left hand bore a rugged staff; his right<br />
Strok'd down the hairs of his expanded beard;<br />
As thus with words of import mild he spoke;<br />
“Fear not, for I will come; my temple leave.<br />
“View but this snake which with his circling folds<br />
“My staff entwines; remark him, that again<br />
“You well may know him; chang'd to such a form<br />
“Will I be; but more huge I will appear;<br />
“Mighty in bulk as heavenly beings ought.”<br />
The vision ceas'd, and vanish'd with the words:<br />
And with the god fled sleep; and cheerful light<br />
Follow'd the flight of Somnus. Now the morn<br />
Had chas'd the starry fires; the Grecian chiefs,<br />
Still dubious, in the splendid temple meet<br />
Of the intreated deity, and pray<br />
That some celestial sign he should display,<br />
To prove which country for his seat he chose.<br />
Scarce had they ended, when the shining god<br />
Fore-running hisses sent; and as a snake<br />
With lofty crest appear'd: at his approach<br />
His statue, altars, portals, gilded roofs,<br />
And marble pavement shook. He rear'd his chest<br />
Sublime amid the temple; and around<br />
Darted his eyes, which shone with living fire.<br />
Trembled the fear-struck crowd. The sacred priest,<br />
His hair encircled with a snowy band,<br />

“Who keep thy rites.” All present to the god<br />
Adoring bend, and all his words repeat;<br />
And Rome's embassadors with fervor join<br />
In mind and voice. To these the god consents,<br />
And his crest moving, certain signs affords:<br />
Thrice hissing, thrice he shakes his forked tongue,<br />
Then down the shining steps he glides, his head<br />
Retorted; as he thence departs he views<br />
His ancient altars, and a last salute,<br />
His wonted seat, his long-own'd temple, gives.<br />
Thence rolls he huge along the ground bestrew'd<br />
With scatter'd flowers, in curving folds entwin'd;<br />
And through the city's centre takes his way,<br />
To where the bending mole the port defends.<br />
Here rested he; and to dismiss appear'd<br />
His followers, and the kind attending crowd,<br />
With gracious looks; then in th' Ausonian ship<br />
He plac'd his length. A deity's huge weight<br />
The ship confess'd; the keel beneath the load<br />
Bent. Glad Æneäs' offspring felt, and loos'd<br />
(A bull first sacrific'd upon the shore,)<br />
The cables which their crowded galley bound.<br />
Light airs impell'd the vessel. High aloft<br />
<a name="page_2_334"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;334]</span>
The god appear'd; upon the curving poop<br />
Rested his neck, and view'd the azure waves.<br />
By zephyrs wafted o'er th' Iönian sea,<br />
They reach'd Italia when the sixth time rose<br />
Aurora. Pass'd Scylacea, and the fane<br />
Of Juno, on Lacinia's noted shore;<br />
Japygia left, and shunn'd Amphissia's rocks<br />
With larboard oars; and, coasting on the right,<br />
Ceraunia, and Romechium pass'd, and pass'd<br />
Narycia and Caulonia; they, (the risks<br />
Of sea, and of Pelorus' narrow straits<br />
Surmounted) pass th' Æolian monarch's isles;<br />
Metallic Themesis; Leucasia's land;<br />
And warm and rosy Pæstus. Thence they coast<br />
Along Capræa; and Minerva's cape;<br />
And pass Surrentum, rich in generous wine,<br />
The town of Hercules; Parthenopé,<br />
Built for soft ease; with Stabia; and from thence<br />
Pass the Cumæan Sybil's sacred dome.<br />
Hence by Linternum, with the mastich rich;<br />
And boiling fountains are they borne; and past<br />
Vulturnus sucking sand within the gulf;<br />
And Sinuessa, fill'd with milk-white doves:<br />
Marshy Minturnæ; with Cajeta, rais'd<br />
By him she nurs'd; Antiphates' abode;<br />
Trachas, by fens encompass'd; Circé's land;<br />
And Antium's solid shore. Here when the crew<br />
<a name="page_2_335"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;335]</span>
Had with toe flying vessel reach'd, (for now<br />
Rough was the main) the god his folds untwines,<br />
Glides on in frequent coils, and spires immense;<br />
Entering a temple of his sire that stood<br />
Close by the yellow beach. The ocean calm'd,<br />
The Epidaurian god his father's fane<br />
Now leaves; a deity to him close join'd<br />
Thus hospitable found: the sandy shore<br />
Ploughs in a furrow with his rattling scales:<br />
Then, in the steersman confident, he rests<br />
On the high poop his head, till they approach<br />
Lavinium's city, and her sacred seat,<br />
And Tiber's mouth. The people rush in heaps,<br />
And crowds of matrons and of fathers rush,<br />
Confus'dly hither; even the vestal maids<br />
Who guard the sacred fire: and all salute<br />
The god with joyful clamor. Then where'er<br />
The rapid vessel cleaves th' opposing stream,<br />
The incense crackles on the banks, and rais'd<br />
Are lines of altars, thick on either shore;<br />
The smoke perfumes the air; the victims bleed<br />
In heaps, and warm the sacrificial knife.<br />
The Roman city now, the world's great head,<br />
They enter'd, up erect the serpent rose;<br />
From the mast's loftiest summit tower'd his neck,<br />
And round he look'd to chuse a fit abode.<br />
The waves circumfluent in two equal streams<br />
<a name="page_2_336"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;336]</span>
Divide; the isle has thence its name, the arms<br />
On either side are stretch'd, land in the midst.<br />
Hither the Æsculapian snake himself<br />
Betook, departing from the Latian ship;<br />
Resum'd his form celestial, and their griefs<br />
Dispersing, came health-bearer to the land.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A foreign power he in our temples stands,<br />
But Cæsar, in his native town a god<br />
Is worshipp'd. In the forum, and the field<br />
Fam'd equal: yet not his well-finish'd wars,<br />
His triumphs, nor the deeds in peace perform'd<br />
So justly chang'd him to an heavenly shape,<br />
A blazing star, as did the son he left.<br />
For no atchievement Cæsar e'er perform'd<br />
Can with the boast to be Augustus' sire<br />
Compare. Far greater this than to subdue<br />
The sea-girt Britons:&mdash;his victorious fleets<br />
To seven-mouth'd Nile to lead;&mdash;to bring the realms<br />
Cinyphian Juba rul'd, 'neath Rome's control,<br />
Rebel Numidia; and, puff'd high in pride<br />
With Mithridates' glory, Pontus' land;<br />
Rich triumphs to have gain'd, and triumphs more<br />
To merit, as a man so great produce;<br />
To whose presiding care, O bounteous gods!<br />
Mankind ye gave, and them completely blest.<br />
And lest he seem from mortal seed to spring<br />
<a name="page_2_337"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;337]</span>
His sire must mount to heaven, in form a god.<br />
This the bright mother of Æneäs saw,<br />
And for the priest beheld a mournful fate<br />
Prepar'd, and moving saw the arms conspir'd.<br />
She trembled, and to every god she met<br />
Address'd her: “Lo! what deep and potent plots<br />
“Against me they prepare. See, with what art<br />
“His life is sought, who sole to me is left<br />
“Of my Iülus. Why must I alone<br />
“Be harrass'd still with never-ceasing cares?<br />
“Whom now Tydides' Calydonian spear<br />
“Wounds; now the walls of ill-protected Troy<br />
“Lie prostrate. Who my darling son behold<br />
“Driv'n to long wanderings; on the ocean toss'd;<br />
“Entering the silent mansions of the dead;<br />
“Waging fierce war with Turnus; or, if truth<br />
“I speak, with Juno rather. Yet why now<br />
“Record I former sufferings in my sons?<br />
“Terror prevents all memory of the past;<br />
“See, where at me their impious swords they point!<br />
“O, I conjure you! stay them; and prevent<br />
“The horrid deed; lest, spilt the high-priest's blood,<br />
“The fires of Vesta be for ever dark.”<br />
With words like these did troubled Venus move<br />
Each power of heaven, in vain; yet all were touch'd,<br />
And, though the stern decrees of rigid fate<br />
To break unable, tokens plain they gave,<br />
<a name="page_2_338"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;338]</span>
That some immense calamity was nigh.<br />
They tell, that clashing arms 'mid the black clouds,<br />
And dreadful horns and trumpets in the heavens<br />
Sounded, to warn us of the impious deed.<br />
Full of solicitude the earth beheld<br />
The pale wan image of sad Ph&oelig;bus' face.<br />
Torches were often seen 'mid heaven to glare;<br />
And from the clouds oft gory drops were shed.<br />
Blue Lucifer a dusky hue o'ercast;<br />
And Luna's car was sprinkled o'er with blood.<br />
Th' infernal owl in numerous places shriek'd,<br />
A direful omen! In a thousand fanes<br />
The ivory statues wept; the sacred groves<br />
Re-echo'd all with songs and threatening sounds.<br />
No victim seem'd appeasing; tumults vast<br />
Approaching shew'd the entrails; and appear'd<br />
The liver always with a wounded head.<br />
Around the domes, and temples of the gods<br />
Loud howl'd the midnight dogs; the silent shades<br />
Flitted along; and tremblings shook the town.<br />
Yet could not these forebodings of the heavens<br />
Crush the conspiracy, or ward his fate;<br />
And in the temple were the weapons drawn:<br />
For, but the senate-house, no spot could please<br />
The vile assassins for the bloody deed.<br />
Then Cytherea smote her lovely breast<br />
In anguish; and beneath an heavenly cloud<br />
<a name="page_2_339"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;339]</span>
Sought to conceal him: such a cloud as once<br />
From furious Menelaüs Paris sav'd;<br />
And snatch'd Æneäs from Tydides' sword.<br />
Then thus her sire: “O daughter! hast thou power<br />
“Th' immutable decrees of fate to change?<br />
“To thee 'tis granted to inspect the dome<br />
“Of the three sisters; there thou wilt behold<br />
“Th' eternal tablets of events engrav'd<br />
“On steel and brass, a work of mighty toil.<br />
“Safe, they nor fear the clashing of the sky,<br />
“Nor rage of thunder, nor of ruin aught.<br />
“There wilt thou written find thy offspring's fate<br />
“On ever-during adamant. Myself<br />
“Have read it, and record it in my mind;<br />
“And lest thou should'st be to the future blind,<br />
“I will relate it. He for whom thou toil'st,<br />
“O Cytherea! has his time fulfill'd;<br />
“The sum of years which to the earth he ow'd.<br />
“That he a deity in heaven may rise,<br />
“And be in temples worshipp'd is thy care,<br />
“And his successor's; who his name will take,<br />
“And on his shoulders bear the wide world's rule;<br />
“On him impos'd. He, of his murder'd sire<br />
“Valiant avenger, shall in all his wars<br />
“Our favoring influence feel. Mutina's walls,<br />
“By him besieg'd, in conquest shall confess<br />
“His power, and sue for peace. Pharsalia, him<br />
<a name="page_2_340"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;340]</span>
“Shall feel; and, drench'd in Macedonian blood<br />
“Again, Philippi. On Sicilia's seas<br />
“His mighty name shall conquer. Egypt's queen,<br />
“Falsely relying on the nuptial bond<br />
“With Rome's triumvir, falls: all vain her threats,<br />
“That Tiber should subservient bend to Nile.<br />
“Why should I speak to thee of barbarous hordes,<br />
“Nations which dwell at either seas' extreme?<br />
“Whatever habitable earth contains<br />
“Will to his empire bend. Ocean will own<br />
“His sway. Peace on th'extended earth bestow'd,<br />
“To civil studies will his breast be turn'd;<br />
“And laws most equitable will he frame.<br />
“By his example curb licentious souls;<br />
“And, stretching forward to a future age<br />
“His anxious care, which their sons' sons may feel,<br />
“His offspring, nurtur'd in a pious womb,<br />
“At once his name and station will assume.<br />
“Nor shall he touch th' ethereal seats, nor join<br />
“His kindred stars till full like him in years.<br />
“Meantime his soul, snatch'd from the mangled corse,<br />
“Form to a brilliant star, a god divine:<br />
“That Julius from his lofty seat may still<br />
“Our forum, and our Capitol behold.”<br />
Scarcely the sire had ceas'd, when Venus, bright,<br />
But unperceiv'd by all, stood in the midst<br />
Of Rome's assembled senate; from the breast<br />
<a name="page_2_341"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;341]</span>
Of her lov'd Cæsar took the recent soul,<br />
Nor let it waste in air. Up to the stars<br />
She bore it. Rapid as she swept along,<br />
She saw it shine with light, she saw it burn;<br />
Then from her bosom spring above the moon:<br />
Lofty it flies, it shines a glittering star,<br />
Dragging a flaming tail's stupendous length.<br />
Viewing the glorious actions of his son,<br />
Candid he grants them mightier than his own,<br />
And thus surpast rejoices. Let him frown,<br />
If to his parent's deeds we his prefer;<br />
Yet fame quite free will such commands despise,<br />
Give him unwish'd-for precedence; and here,<br />
And here alone he'll disobedience find.<br />
So Atreus yielded to the mighty fame<br />
Of Agamemnon; Theseus so surpass'd<br />
Ægeus; and Achilles Peleus so.<br />
Nay more, examples nearer to themselves<br />
If I should use, Saturn submits to Jove.<br />
Jove rules th' ethereal sky, the triform world;<br />
And all the earth beneath Augustus lies:<br />
Each is the sire and ruler of his realm.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, I implore, ye gods! who did attend<br />
Æneäs,&mdash;who made fire and sword retreat!<br />
Ye native deities of Latium's soil!<br />
Quirinus, founder of the walls of Rome!<br />
<a name="page_2_342"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;342]</span>
Mars, of Quirinus never-conquer'd, sire!<br />
Vesta, held sacred midst the Cæsars' gods!<br />

And Jove, who guards the high Tarpeiän walls!<br />
With all whom pious poets may invoke;<br />
Slow may that day arrive, and older far<br />
Than what our age may see, when to the clouds<br />
His glorious head shall mount, quitting this globe<br />
He rules so well, and our beseeching prayers<br />
Bending with condescending ear to grant.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is my work complete, which not Jove's ire,<br />

Which nothing, save my mortal frame, can touch.<br />
Which ends the being of a dubious life,<br />
My better part unperishing shall mount<br />
Above the loftiest stars. Eternal still<br />
Shall be my name. Where'er Rome's power extends<br />
O'er conquer'd earth, my verses shall be read;<br />
And, if the presages by poets given<br />
Be true, to endless years my fame shall live.<br />
